## [Unreleased]

## [0.99.65] - 2026-05-15

Same-day cherry-pick on top of v0.99.64 to repair the release-pipeline build. Debian Bullseye's multi-arch apt resolver couldn't reconcile the pre-installed `linux-libc-dev:amd64` against a newer `linux-libc-dev:arm64` from the mirror, blocking `libc6-dev:arm64` install in both the Pi and Pi32 Docker toolchain images. No code changes — same payload as v0.99.64.

### Fixed

- **Pi and Pi32 release builds were blocked by a Debian Bullseye multi-arch apt skew** — `libc6-dev:arm64` (and the armhf equivalent) couldn't be installed because the `linux-libc-dev` version baked into the amd64 base image diverged from the arm64/armhf version on Debian's mirror, so apt refused with "Depends: linux-libc-dev:arm64 but it is not going to be installed". `docker/Dockerfile.pi` and `docker/Dockerfile.pi32` now list `linux-libc-dev:amd64` and `linux-libc-dev:<target-arch>` together in the apt install line, forcing apt to pick a matching version pair. Caught when v0.99.64's release pipeline failed Pi/Pi32 jobs; the other eight platforms built fine.

## [0.99.64] - 2026-05-15

A **unified exclude-objects side panel** with 3D selection brackets replaces the old fullscreen overlay, plus fixes for **CJK font rendering** of new translation keys, an **LVGL flex gap regression** when the first child is hidden, **STRING-subject image binding** (the print-status thumbnail was stuck on the benchy placeholder), and **missing-glyph arrows** in two user-facing dialogs.

### Added

- **Unified exclude-objects side panel** — the fullscreen exclude-objects list is replaced by a slide-in side panel pinned over the print-status controls column. Map view stays in the thumbnail card, the gcode viewer keeps full width (2D / 3D), and the list lands on the right at ~44% in every mode. Row taps and viewer taps fire the same confirm modal; row taps also pulse the matching object's highlight in the viewer for cross-pane feedback. The 3D viewer gains GLES corner-bracket rendering for highlighted objects (line shader + per-frame VBO inside the FBO, sharing the geometry-pass MVP); 2D and 3D both share `AABB::for_each_bracket_arm()` so the bracket geometry stays in lockstep. Bbox-projection fallback in `pick_object` fixes wrong-object picks after the geometry pass clears segments.

### Fixed

- **Print-status thumbnails were stuck on the benchy placeholder** — `bind_src` in helix-xml only handled `LV_SUBJECT_TYPE_POINTER`; STRING subjects (e.g. `print_thumbnail_path`, `print_status_idle_thumb_path`) silently fell back to the static XML `src=`. STRING subjects now route through a local observer that calls `lv_image_set_src` on the resolved path.
- **Flex layout left an unwanted gap before the first laid-out child** when that child was hidden and the next visible sibling had `flex_grow>0` — backport of upstream lvgl/lvgl#9897; the patch is wired into `mk/patches.mk` so submodule resets don't lose it.
- **Missing-glyph arrow boxes in two user-facing dialogs** — the bundled NotoSans Regular/Bold/Light TTFs don't include U+2190–U+2193, so the multi-tool material-mismatch row and the internal-error toast rendered a tofu box where an arrow was supposed to be. Replaced with `->` and `Settings > About` respectively.

### Changed

- **CJK fonts regenerated for new translation keys** — 1127 new CJK characters from the latest translation sync are now included in `noto_sans_cjk_*.bin`, so Chinese/Japanese locales render the new strings (Library, Objects, Show temp for, Follow active tool, Keep Navigation Bar, etc.) instead of falling back to a missing-glyph box.
- **Translation keys synced across all locales** — 7 new keys added with non-English locales populated as untranslated placeholders; compiled artifacts regenerated.
- **Docs: QIDI Q2 stock-firmware 1-line installer + WiFi confirmed working.**

## [0.99.63] - 2026-05-15

This release lands the **Detailed print-status layout** — a multi-tool-aware redesign with per-nozzle temperature pinning, a Library/Detailed picker, and an idle hero pulling thumbnails from print history — plus **3D gcode-viewer performance wins** (vertex packing 36→20 bytes for ~44% buffer reduction, in-place tool-color patching), a **real input-shaper wizard abort** when you back out mid-calibration, and a fix for **settings loss on flash power-loss** by `fsync`'ing `settings.json` and its parent directory.

### Added

- **Detailed print-status layout** — new `Detailed` option in the print-status layout picker (alongside Library), with a multi-tool-aware UI: per-nozzle temperature row using `Nozzle N` display names, tool-pinning picker that fixes the displayed nozzle to a specific extruder, idle hero populated from `PrintHistoryManager`, progress arc with the `%` label nested inside, layer/time/filament rows, and width-gating so the full detail set only appears at sufficient breakpoints. Persisted via `layout_style` and `nozzle_tool_override` config keys.
- **`multi_tool` subject + `T<n>` active-tool label** — print-status exposes a multi-tool subject; the T-label tracks the pinned tool when set, otherwise auto-follows the active extruder.
- **Temperature-graph legend overflow pill** — when more sensors are charted than fit, the legend truncates with a `+N` pill so the chart doesn't get squeezed by an over-long label row.
- **Qidi X-Smart 3 in printer database** — initial profile added; QIDI docs clarified that FreeDi runs as a remote client.

### Fixed

- **Input-shaper wizard now aborts in-progress calibration when you back out** (prestonbrown/helixscreen#945) — exiting mid-calibration previously left the chain running on the printer; the wizard now sends a real abort and allows a clean restart on re-entry.
- **Settings survive flash power-loss** (prestonbrown/helixscreen#943) — `Config::save_settings()` now `fsync`'s `settings.json` and its parent directory before returning. Companion: forced touch-calibration skips when a valid saved cal exists, so a power-loss-induced incomplete write doesn't trigger a recalibration prompt.
- **Android: SDL surface resize propagates through LVGL + theme refresh** (prestonbrown/helixscreen#941) — clamshell foldables (Galaxy Z Flip 7, Fold series) now redraw correctly when the screen geometry changes mid-session.
- **DNS: fail closed on embedded ARM/MIPS when `dns_resolv` fails** — silent DNS misconfiguration on resource-constrained devices no longer surfaces as a generic connection failure with no diagnostic.
- **Indev cancellation on navigation teardown** (prestonbrown/helixscreen#906) — in-flight input-device events at panel/overlay teardown boundaries are now cancelled cleanly, closing one of the L081 Mechanism C surfaces.
- **AfcConfigManager bg-thread access** — residual L081 Mechanism C site flagged by the extended `->expired()` lint.
- **AmsState print-state observer UAF across deinit cycles** — caught by the nightly test gate; observer/lifetime ordering corrected.
- **Memory: pressure-driven viewer release with telemetry context** — dropped the static `is_low_memory` gate in favor of a runtime pressure signal; trigger reason recoverable from bundles.
- **Auto-discovered chamber sensor promoted to CHAMBER role** — sensors discovered via Klipper introspection now correctly classified; chamber-override path skips redundant work when the sensor is already chamber-classified.
- **Temperature graph: stale widget tolerated on config-save** (bundle RP293UCW) — chart hide-pre-delete prevents a crash when the user saves config while the temp graph is mid-redraw.
- **Temperature graph: consistent `Nozzle N` labels in mini-graph + multi-tool defaults; X-axis labels gated on rowspan, not colspan; extruders sorted for stable ordering.**
- **Print library button outlines no longer clip top/bottom** — extra padding restored.
- **Settings > Hardware Health entry now shows unconditionally** — previously hidden behind a stale capability check.
- **M117 row deduplicated and surfaced on the full print panel** — message was being echoed in two places under certain print states.
- **Printer-list spacing** — breathing room added between rows and the `Add Printer` button.

### Changed

- **3D gcode viewer: PackedVertex layout shrunk 36 → 20 bytes** — octahedral normal encoding + RGBA8 color packing cuts vertex buffer size ~44%; companion test updates.
- **3D gcode viewer: tool color changes patch the prepared buffer in place** instead of dumping and rebuilding it, eliminating a noticeable hitch when toggling per-tool colors mid-view.
- **Memory: 'good tier' RSS thresholds scale as a fraction of total RAM** — fixed-MB thresholds were over-eager on small devices and over-permissive on large ones; thresholds now scale with installed RAM.
- **Temperature graph: pre-discovery configs auto-upgrade on load** — removes a class of config-load mismatches when migrating from an older profile snapshot; partition logic simplified.
- **Nightly CI captures core dumps on test-all failure** — failed tests now leave a recoverable artifact for backtrace resolution instead of an opaque failure log.
- **Docs: CC1 OpenCentauri COSMOS links repaired; CC1 architecture clarified as `armv7-a`.**

## [0.99.62] - 2026-05-13

This release lands the **XML linter as a CI gate** (and the ~50 XML cleanups it surfaced), **gcode-streaming polish** for OrcaSlicer and purge/wipe-tower geometry, **launcher and installer hardening** (env preservation on upgrade, rolling-backup sweep on clean, tolerant env parsing with warnings instead of silent abort), and a **local-exec recovery script** that replaces the Moonraker `shell_command` path which never worked on printers without the `helix_recover` macro. Plus an updater fix for a 32-bit `statvfs` overflow that falsely reported "no space" on Pi.

### Added

- **Touch-calibration force honored across wizard and standalone paths** — the wizard's force-recalibrate option and the `--force-touch-calibration` standalone entry point now route through the same path so either reliably triggers a fresh calibration regardless of which one ran.
- **Gcode viewer excludes purge tower and wipe tower from 2D auto-fit bounding box** — slicers that emit a purge/wipe block at the bed edge no longer drag the preview camera off the actual print; the model fills the viewport like it should.
- **About screen surfaces kernel arch + userspace bitness** — useful for triaging cross-arch reports (e.g., SonicPad: aarch64 kernel running armhf userspace). The About panel now shows both lines so debug bundles don't have to guess.
- **Installer sweeps rolling config-backup directories on uninstall and clean** — `~/.helixscreen-backup.*` directories from prior upgrades used to accumulate forever; `uninstall` and `clean` paths now sweep them.
- **XML linter (`helix-xml-linter`) vendored and wired as a CI gate** — imported from GhostTypes/helix-xml-linter@2124093, auto-discovers widgets and design-token constants from the source tree, and runs as a CI gate via the Makefile. Catches unknown-const-refs, silently-dropped attributes, and style-prop typos at lint time instead of at runtime where they'd surface as warnings or misrendered widgets.

### Fixed

- **Installer no longer deletes bundled `helixscreen.env` on upgrade** — prior versions wiped the user's env file during upgrade, taking any custom log level / mock config / language override with it. The upgrade path now leaves it in place; only `uninstall` removes it.
- **Recovery probe uses local `helix-recover.sh` instead of the dead Moonraker `shell_command` path** — printers without the `helix_recover` macro in their Klipper config (most non-Klipper-default builds) had no working recovery action; the probe would fall back to a "method not found" toast or worse, no-op silently. The probe now exec's a local script bundled with the installer, removing the firmware-side dependency entirely.
- **Updater "no space" false-positive on 32-bit Pi (and other armhf platforms)** — `statvfs::f_bavail * f_frsize` overflowed `unsigned long` on armv7, returning 0 even on disks with tens of gigabytes free. Widened the multiplication to `uint64_t` so reported free-space is honest. Adjacent to the prior systemd-namespace `statvfs` mystery (bundle 7ZGHW5KX) but a different mechanism.
- **Update manifest now publishes installer size; fallback floor lowered 200 → 120 MB** — the "minimum required free space" preflight was over-conservative when the manifest size key was absent. Now uses the published size when present and a tighter fallback otherwise.
- **EGL init failure on backdrop-blur is sticky for the boot session** — when GPU-accelerated backdrop blur failed once, the retry loop kept hammering EGL on every frame and spamming logs. First failure now disables the path for the rest of the session; the user gets the software fallback without the log noise.
- **Gcode streaming parser polish** — four targeted fixes to the streaming path: purge filter now applies to full-file mode too (was streaming-only); OrcaSlicer `;LAYER_CHANGE` markers index correctly without false positives on similar substrings; parser position is seeded per-layer so partial reads pick up correctly; axis extraction truncates at `;` comments so commented G1 values don't pollute bbox math.
- **Launcher tolerant env-file parsing with malformed-line warnings** — malformed lines in `helixscreen.env` (bad quoting, stray characters, unterminated strings) used to abort startup with an opaque shell error. The launcher now warns about the bad line and continues with the rest of the file, so one broken variable doesn't leave the app unable to launch.
- **launcher.log moved off tmpfs, prefers FHS `/var/log/helixscreen/`** — `/tmp` is cleared on reboot on many platforms, so launcher.log was already gone by the time anyone could read it after a boot-time crash. Now persists under `/var/log/helixscreen/` with a fallback for permissions-restricted environments.
- **Logging: console sink disabled under daemon mode; per-frame trace spam removed from icon + filament path** — daemon-mode runs had duplicate console output going to journald in addition to the file sink; the console sink is now suppressed when running detached. Separately, two TRACE-level call sites in the icon-cache and filament-path render were firing at 60 Hz; both demoted/removed to silence the spam.
- **About screen logo no longer looks misaligned** — `helixscreen-logo.png` had a baked-in transparent border that made the rendered logo appear off-center in the About panel; cropped at the asset.
- **Installer hardening: uninstall→reinstall race + self-delete guards** — back-to-back uninstall+install (e.g., from the in-app reinstall path, or from a forced reinstall on the update path) could leave the installer mid-flight when its own `$0` lived inside `$INSTALL_DIR`. New `guard_self_delete` + sentinel-path machinery refuses to remove the directory that's currently executing, with clear error messages instead of mysterious half-states.
- **L081 Mechanism C sweep: residual bg-thread `tok.expired()` guards removed** — follow-up to the v0.99.60 codebase-wide cleanup, picking up the remaining redundant guards the strict-mode runtime detector continued to flag.
- **~50 XML correctness fixes surfaced by the new linter** — every cleanup the linter found, batched: unknown-const-refs (`#nonexistent_token` references), style-prop typos (`stryle_pad_all`, CSS-name aliases that LVGL doesn't honor), silently-dropped attributes replaced with their actual LVGL equivalents, `variant="muted"` removed from widgets that don't accept it or where it was redundant on `text_small`/`text_body`, `flag_` prefix and `flags=` shortcut normalized to per-flag attributes, `text_input` attributes (`placeholder`, `keyboard`) standardized, `ui_button` cleanup, and `setting_dropdown_row hide_description` properly wired.

### Changed

- **LVGL `lv_image_set_src` warning now includes object + parent name** — when an image fails to load, the diagnostic identifies *which* image so it's actually triageable instead of a generic "couldn't load image" pointer-style log. Internal LVGL patch (`lvgl-image-set-src-warning-context.patch`).
- **Docs: comprehensive log destinations and retrieval per platform** — new docs page covering where logs live and how to fetch them on Pi, K1, K2, AD5M/AD5X, SonicPad, CC1, and Snapmaker U1, because the answer is different on every device.

## [0.99.61] - 2026-05-13

A round of **launch-time and connect-time UX polish** plus **home-screen widget polish**: the Klipper recovery dialog no longer flashes briefly when starting the app or adding a printer, the home panel no longer renders blank after switching printers, and the Snapmaker U1 wizard correctly identifies a U1 instead of showing *UNKNOWN*. Tapping a fan tile now opens fan control instead of the picker, the fan dial debounces drag-induced Moonraker sends, and the rest of the icon widgets center their icon+label as a group when labels are on. Plus a fix for the M300 sound feedback loop on hosts without a Klipper-declared beeper, the AD5X *Method not found* toast on the recovery probe, and a wake-from-sleep regression during prints when sleep-while-printing is disabled.

### Added

- **Android: "Keep Navigation Bar" setting** — Display & Sound > Appearance now has a toggle (Android only) that pins the system nav bar onscreen instead of using immersive mode + swipe-to-reveal. For users who prefer 3-button nav over gesture controls (prestonbrown/helixscreen#908).

### Fixed

- **Display stays asleep mid-print when `sleep_while_printing=false` (bundle RYAQGL6C)** — `check_display_sleep()` returned early when a print was active, but the early return also skipped the wake-on-touch path. If the display had entered sleep *before* the print started, the user was stranded on a blank screen for the duration of the print (RYAQGL6C: 8 touch events, 18-minute wake delay). Wake requests now fire during prints; only the *entering* of sleep is suppressed.
- **Klipper recovery dialog no longer flashes briefly at launch or after Add Printer** — `PrinterNetworkState` initializes `klippy_state` to SHUTDOWN as a conservative default; the EmergencyStopOverlay observer fired once with this placeholder at subscribe time, briefly showing the recovery dialog before Moonraker reported real state. Same placeholder also injected the `firmware_restart` widget on the home panel for a few frames. Two targeted guards: the overlay drops the initial placeholder fire on every (re)subscription (singleton flag was sticky after the first launch, so Add Printer's soft restart re-triggered the flash), and `PanelWidgetManager` gates `firmware_restart` widget injection on `printer_connection_state == CONNECTED`. Genuine shutdown-at-startup is still surfaced via the parallel `KLIPPY_SHUTDOWN` event path. Regression introduced by 1d13ed6b4's freeze-buffering rework, which was previously masking the placeholder fire.
- **"Request Failed: Method not found" toast on recovery probe (bundle VHXPB8A3)** — `PrinterRecoveryService` probes `shell_command:helix_recover` and falls back to `printer.firmware_restart` if the macro isn't defined; the probe surfaced a scary toast even though the fallback succeeded (AD5X without the macro). `MoonrakerAPI::run_shell_command` gains a `silent` flag; the recovery probe uses it so the global RPC_ERROR event is suppressed for that one call.
- **Home panel blank after switching printers** — `tear_down_printer_state()` destroys the HomePanel singleton; the re-created instance has `finalized_=false`. The cold-launch path calls `finalize_setup()` after `create_overlays()`, but the soft-restart path used by switch_printer didn't, so the home panel rendered as an empty container until next navigation.
- **Snapmaker U1 wizard now identifies as Snapmaker U1, not "UNKNOWN"** — original heuristics matched a hypothetical RFID-extended firmware (`fm175xx_reader`, `FILAMENT_DT_UPDATE/QUERY`) that doesn't exist on stock U1s. Replaced with patterns verified against a live device: `homing_precise_corexy`, `extruder_offset_calibration`, `filament_entangle_detect`, `machine_state_manager`, `defect_detection`, `purifier`, plus the `FEEDING_RUNOUT_EVENT_HANDLE` and `EXTRUDER_OFFSET_ACTION_PROBE_CALIBRATE_ALL` macros. Old RFID heuristics retained as secondary path for future firmware variants. Kinematics corrected from cartesian to corexy (matches `homing_precise_corexy` + tmc2240 stepper_x/y wiring).
- **M300 sound feedback loop on hosts without a Klipper-declared beeper** — `SoundManager::create_backend()` fell through to the M300 (Klipper gcode beeper) backend whenever Moonraker was connected and no host audio backend (SDL/ALSA/PWM) initialized. On any printer whose Klipper config lacks `[output_pin BEEPER]` + `[gcode_macro M300]`, every UI sound triggered `M300` → `!! Unknown command:M300` → gcode error toast → error_tone sound → M300 feedback loop. Surfaced as "no audio + spam of unknown command M300" on hosts where local audio fails (e.g. Pi where ALSA `default` fails to open). M300 is now installed lazily from `PrinterCapabilitiesState::set_hardware()` only when `hardware.has_speaker()` is true (PrinterDiscovery detects `[output_pin BEEPER/BUZZER/SPEAKER]` in the Klipper config). `set_moonraker_client(nullptr)` drops an active M300 backend so printer switches don't carry it across.
- **Modal dialog sized too tall for short messages** — Save Hardware, Reset to defaults, and similar short confirmations were stuck at 200px regardless of message length, with content stretched to fill (two regressions in `modal_dialog.xml`: `style_min_height=200` from f48ceb70c, `flex_grow=1` on `content_container` from 3482bb989). Content container is now `height=content` with a responsive `#dialog_content_max` token (140/200/260/320/440/600/800 across breakpoints), keeping OK/Cancel on-screen with long content.
- **L081 Mechanism C anti-pattern in `PrintHistoryManager` and `ControlsPanel::handle_home_all`** — bare `if (token.expired()) return;` on a bg thread followed by `this`/member access is a TOCTOU race; detector hit on v0.99.60/ad5x for both callsites. `PrintHistoryManager::subscribe_to_notifications` drops the bare expired check in the WS `notify_history_changed` callback (defer's own guard runs atomically on the main thread). `ControlsPanel::handle_home_all` rewrites the `home_axes` success/error callbacks to use `lifetime_.bg_cb()` instead of manual `tok.defer` with the forbidden bg-thread expired prelude.
- **Tapping a fan widget now opens fan control, not the fan picker** — the fan tile's normal tap showed the *which fan to monitor* picker on every click. That picker is a configuration choice and belongs behind the edit-mode gear; mirrors the FanStackWidget pattern. Normal tap now pushes the fan control overlay; `on_edit_configure` still opens the picker.
- **Fan dial drag debounces SET_FAN_SPEED instead of flooding Moonraker** — dragging the fan dial fired `SET_FAN_SPEED` on every `VALUE_CHANGED` tick, flooding Moonraker mid-drag. Latest value is stashed in a 500ms one-shot timer that resets on each tick; `RELEASED` (or `PRESS_LOST`) flushes immediately so letting go feels responsive. Timer is cancelled in dtor and move ops to keep its `this` user_data safe.
- **Belt-tension panel's orphaned "Freq Graph" button removed** — the button toasted *coming soon* on every press; gone, along with its handler stub and calibration-doc reference.
- **Icon widgets center icon and label as a vertically-stacked group when labels are on** — macros, favorite_macro, motion, lock, led, led_controls, gcode_console, shutdown, network, firmware_restart, and notifications now use the same flex-column layout as temperature: icon and label flow as a centered pair when `show_widget_labels` is on; the label drops out of layout (`LV_OBJ_FLAG_HIDDEN`) when off so the icon re-centers alone in the cell. `panel_widget_ams` and `panel_widget_active_spool` are intentionally left alone (their inner content fills 100%/100% and would clip in a flex column).

### Changed

- **Hardware Issues moved from Settings > System to Settings > Hardware & Devices** — the Hardware Issues row (visible when hardware validation detects missing/changed hardware) lived next to network/telemetry/factory-reset, but it's about printer hardware; it now sits above Printers in the Hardware & Devices overlay where users actually look. User docs and TROUBLESHOOTING.md updated for the new path (`Settings > Hardware Health` → `Settings > Hardware & Devices > Hardware Issues`).
- **Docs refresh** — README, USER_GUIDE, FAQ, INSTALL, ROADMAP, and PRINTER_MANAGER updated with current counts (80+ printers, 7 filament backends, 300+ XML components) and aligned hardware-frugality framing for the 1.0 hero/bullet/FAQ language.

## [0.99.60] - 2026-05-11

The headline is the **completion of the L081 Mechanism C sweep** — 107 background-thread callsites across panels, modals, wizards, calibration, AMS backends, and macro/print preparation chains now route LVGL touches through `tok.defer` / the new `bg_cb` helper, with the strict-mode abort detector active in tests/CI to keep new regressions from landing. Pairs with two AMS firmware-writeback features (CFS via `BOX_MODIFY_TN_DATA`, Snapmaker via `filament_detect/set` Extended Firmware) that finally make color edits persist to the printer, and the **layered filament-path renderer** flipping default-on (legacy renderer deleted) for smoother animation. Round it out with **CFS hardware-error UX** surfacing key8xx faults via `respond_raw` with a recovery chain + purge-gate, and a **WiFi auto-recovery** path for stale NM profiles missing `key-mgmt`.

### Added

- **AMS color firmware-writeback** — color edits in the UI now persist back to the printer firmware. CFS uses `BOX_MODIFY_TN_DATA`; Snapmaker uses `filament_detect/set` (Extended Firmware). Slots auto-mirror firmware-detected colors into `lane_data` so OrcaSlicer sees the same source of truth.
- **"Print Paused" overlay with reason** — status panel now surfaces the pause reason instead of a generic spinner.
- **CFS pre-print step indicator** — synthesizes Cut / Feed / Retract / Purge phases from physical signals (cutter trigger, extruder motion, filament sensor) so the load step row reflects what the box is actually doing.
- **Pre-print `requires_macro` gate** — firmware-dependent options now declare which macro they need; the option row hides when the macro is absent instead of erroring at run time.
- **WiFi auto-recovery for stale NetworkManager profiles** — when a saved connection is missing `key-mgmt` (common after firmware updates or hand-edited keyfiles), we now rewrite the profile and reconnect instead of failing silently.
- **`bg_cb` helper + L081 strict-mode detector** — `lifetime_.bg_cb(tag, fn)` returns a callable that auto-defers the body to the main thread; the runtime detector now aborts under `HELIX_STRICT_BG_THREAD_CHECK=1` (default in `HelixTestFixture`) so new Mechanism C anti-pattern instances fail tests immediately.
- **L081 Mechanism D (freeze-drop) telemetry watch + aggregator** — `telemetry-crashes.py` gains anomaly watch mode; `freeze-drops.sh` aggregates `DROPPED (shutdown)` events across Pi/K2/CC1 (busybox `logread` + `/var/log/messages`).

### Fixed

- **L081 Mechanism C: 107 background-thread callsites across the codebase** — LedController, PrintSelectPanel, belt_tension_calibrator (17 sites), 6 AMS backends, macro/print/preparation chains, UI panels (including real LVGL-from-bg bugs caught by the detector), wizards/modals/overlays, and `camera_stream` all now wrap LVGL touches in `tok.defer` or use `bg_cb`. The forbidden bare `if (tok.expired()) return;` followed by `this`/member access is now gated by lint + strict-mode runtime abort.
- **Layered filament-path renderer is now default; legacy renderer deleted** — the `HELIX_LAYERED_FILAMENT_PATH` scaffold shipped behind a flag last cycle; this release flips the default and removes the old single-pass renderer and `render_cache_` member. LINEAR/HUB topologies now split flow/heat/tip into the `DRAW_POST` pass; PARALLEL splits the animation into `DRAW_POST` as well. Per-setter dirty flags + cached rendered output skip redraws when nothing changed.
- **UpdateQueue::scoped_freeze buffers callbacks instead of dropping** — freeze now splices buffered work back on release; `defer_critical` / `queue_critical` removed (single path covers all cases). `freeze-drops.sh` watches `DROPPED (shutdown)` only — should be zero on builds ≥ 2026-05-11.
- **CFS hardware errors (key8xx) surface via `respond_raw` with recovery + purge-gate** — K2 box driver reports faults as `!!` log lines that `dispatch_action_script` swallowed silently. The modal upgrade for key8xx now offers the recovery chain and gates the purge action behind the user actually clearing the error.
- **AMS state shows "Printing" / "Paused" while a print is active** — status string was stuck on "Idle" because the print-state listener wasn't wired through the AMS card. Now reflects the live `print_stats.state`.
- **GCode viewer streaming mode honors per-tool palette** — the streaming path lost per-tool palette indexing during the v0.99.59 refactor; multi-color prints rendered in T0's color again. Now indexes by the slicer-recorded tool.
- **AD5X IFS tool-mapping caps when plugin is loaded** — `{true, true}` when lessWaste/bambufy active, `{false, false}` for native ZMOD; previously inconsistent.
- **Snapmaker AMS seeds identity `tool_to_slot_map` in constructor** — first-frame render before firmware ACK no longer shows an empty mapping.
- **Snapmaker U1 platform hook no longer kills `lmd` / `unisrv`** — those are camera/timelapse daemons, not competing UIs; killing them broke TIMELAPSE_START. Hook now auto-recovers if they were previously killed.
- **Installer finds `moonraker.conf` on AD5X ZMOD chroot paths** (prestonbrown/helixscreen#938).
- **Installer doesn't kill Snapmaker `unisrv` in competing-UI sweep** (same root cause as the U1 hook fix).
- **AMS filament-remap card hides on backends without editable mapping** — was showing a dead UI on AFC/Happy Hare setups.
- **AMS color_set uses explicit flag, not `color_rgb == 0` sentinel** — legitimately-black filaments no longer get treated as "unset." Companion to the IFS `check_external_color_change` switch from `0 = no-signal` to `optional`.
- **Print-select inlines post-`defer_critical` `MetadataUpdate`** — the metadata flag was getting stuck after a freeze drop; now escapes the freeze with an inline path and self-heals.
- **AMS step indicator anchored to physical heating + live temp label** — the indicator was floating relative to the wrong subject.
- **macOS nightly test gate** — `execute_gcode`-routing change halted the macOS CI gate; re-aligned.

### Changed

- **Calibration docs** — fixed wrong config path; expanded recovery options.
- **belt_tension_calibrator** — collapsed 17 trivial long-form `tok.defer` blocks to `bg_cb`.
- **AD5X IFS** — non-zcolor `gcode_response` lines now drop on the bg thread before the defer hop (less main-thread churn).

## [0.99.59] - 2026-05-09

The headline is **diagnostic instrumentation for the post-v0.99.58 cluster:pstat-async-delete recurrence**. Bundle 3XNZQB2R crashed via a corrupted per-widget event-handler callback — a corruption surface distinct from the global event_stack v0.99.55-56 fixed. v0.99.59 adds three runtime detectors that convert the crash into a recoverable anomaly + name the widget, and wraps the five Mechanism C anti-pattern callsites the bg-thread detector found on first AD5M deploy.

### Added

- **Three runtime detectors for cluster:pstat-async-delete (3XNZQB2R)** — (1) LVGL dispatch gate snapshots `dsc->cb` and validates against the binary's text segment, converting a corrupted callback into an `event_dsc_cb_oob` anomaly instead of a crash; (2) widget identity capture writes `event_target_class:` + `event_target_name:` lines in crash dumps so we get "lv_button (recovery_dismiss_btn)" instead of just hex; (3) `LifetimeToken::expired()` fires `bg_tok_expired_check` anomalies when the L081 Mechanism C anti-pattern is hit (alive token + non-main thread), with per-thread first-fire deduplication.
- **AMS CFS tool remap via `BOX_MODIFY_TN`** — pre-print options can remap a slot's tool number through the CFS endpoint when the user picks a different tool, with a toast on backend rejection.
- **Friendly hardware label in installer output** — installer prints "Raspberry Pi 4" alongside the `pi` platform tag so users can sanity-check the tarball before flashing.

### Fixed

- **5 background-thread Mechanism C callsites surfaced by the bg-thread detector on first AD5M boot.** `JobQueueState::fetch` was the only outright UAF — its success cb called `on_queue_fetched` which then did `lifetime_.defer()` from the bg thread (#707 race). `MacroModificationManager::check_and_notify` + `analyze_and_launch_wizard` did inline `ToastManager::show()` and member writes on the analyzer's HTTP thread. The other three (`PrintHistoryManager::fetch`, `PrintPreparationManager::analyze_print_start_macro_internal`, `NetworkSettingsOverlay::update_ethernet_status`) already used `tok.defer` for the actual mutation but kept a defensive `tok.expired()` bg-check; simplified to drop the bare check (defer's own guard handles expiry).
- **Multi-color prints sliced to a non-T0 initial tool no longer render in T0's color** — `GCodeLayerRenderer` indexed the palette by `palette[0]` instead of the slicer-recorded initial tool, so any non-T0 starting filament rendered as the wrong color until the first `T<N>` change. Now indexes by `metadata.initial_tool_index`.
- **`helixscreen.env` no longer overrides in-app Log Level setting** — the shipped `.env` had `HELIX_LOG_LEVEL=INFO` which silently shadowed the user's choice in Settings → Logging. Env var is now a fallback when the persisted setting is unset.
- **mdns thread re-assignment crash on rebroadcast (bundle UBZQ94EE)** — reassigned `responder_thread_` without joining; `std::terminate` if the prior responder was still finishing. Now joins first.
- **bed_mesh renderer mutex (bundle N3JTFPA5)** — pixel-format / size mutations weren't holding `render_mutex_`, racing the render thread reading the same fields → SEGV in `argb8888_image_blend`. Same Mechanism B shape as the v0.99.55 gcode_layer fix, applied here.
- **`AmsCurrentToolText` observer bound before `AmsState` subjects existed** — initialization ran during static init, leaving the observer pointed at a placeholder. Now invoked after `AmsState::init_subjects()`.
- **AMS slot color-dot label was empty for `current_tool`-only setups** — `set_current_tool` now mirrors the value to `current_slot` so the color-dot widget renders.
- **PrintStatusPanel double-attached its collector when reconnecting mid-print** — second collector double-counted filament usage. Now suppressed when the active-job state arrives via reconnect.
- **Print-start remap restore deferred until after crash-recovery modal closes** — `restore_user_remap()` raced the modal's tear-down. Now hops via `queue_update`.
- **Installer service `Group=` resolution** — assumed `User==Group`, broke on Armbian configs where the install user is in a different primary group. Now resolves via `id -gn ${INSTALL_USER}`.
- **KIAUH `get_confirm()` keyword arg** — 6.2.x tightened the signature; positional `default_choice` now `TypeError`s. Pass as keyword.

### Changed

- **Filament-color metadata parsing consolidated** — gcode-thumbnail and gcode-viewer paths both had their own copies of `;filament_colour =` parsing. Single helper in `GCodeMetadata::parse_filament_colors()`. Behavior unchanged.

## [0.99.58] - 2026-05-08

### Fixed

- **Silent Moonraker request loss during connect/reconnect (#909)** — libhv's `WebSocketClient::send` only checks that the channel exists, not that the WS protocol is past `CONNECTING` / `WS_UPGRADING` / `RECONNECTING`. A send issued in those windows wrote WS frame bytes onto a stream Moonraker treats as still-handshaking, so the bytes were silently dropped and the request sat in `MoonrakerRequestTracker::pending_requests_` until the 60s timeout — or forever, if the calling panel had already cleared its in-flight flag. Surfaced as the K2 Plus startup race where `PrintSelectPanel::refresh_files` issued `get_directory` before `onopen` and the panel stuck on its refresh spinner for hours with no timeout warning. `MoonrakerClient::ready_to_send()` now gates all four `send_jsonrpc` overloads on `connection_state_ == CONNECTED`; the 5-arg overload fires the caller's `error_cb` synchronously with `CONNECTION_LOST` so panels see immediate failure instead of silence. Adds debug-visibility instrumentation to the tracker's timeout sweep so future regressions surface as a stuck queue in bundles.
- **Background Moonraker/HTTP callbacks now marshal LVGL work to the main thread (#933)** — several success/error callbacks in `PrintStatusPanel` (gcode-for-viewing download, reprint error path) and `CrashReportModal::send_with_bundle` captured a lifetime token and checked `tok.expired()` but ran the body inline on the WebSocket / HttpExecutor worker thread. Bodies that touched LVGL widgets (`safe_delete`, `lv_qrcode_create`, modal `hide`, `ui_set_button_enabled`) raced the render loop and produced the L081-cluster heap corruption surfacing as SIGSEGV in `get_prop_core` / `layout_update_core` the next frame. All affected callbacks now wrap their LVGL touches in `tok.defer(...)` so the work runs on the main thread. Telemetry: WKC5J9SK (ad5x v0.99.56), B4SG5M79 (k1 v0.99.53).

## [0.99.57] - 2026-05-07

### Added

- **Shutdown / Reboot rows in Advanced settings** — adds a POWER section to the Advanced panel with Shutdown and Reboot rows that open the same ShutdownModal the home-panel power widget uses. Single-/dual-host scope, Moonraker-disconnect → local `SystemPower` fallback, and the deferred screen-on-ack ordering for the *Both* flow are preserved. The widget's `handle_click` and its six `execute_*` methods are extracted into a free `helix::show_shutdown_dialog()` helper so the widget and the panel rows share one wiring instead of duplicating it.

### Fixed

- **Multi-tool prints sliced to a non-T0 tool no longer render in T0's color** — in streaming mode (large gcode files on memory-constrained hosts), `GCodeStreamingController` parsed each layer with a fresh `GCodeParser`, so the `T<N>` issued in the file's prologue was invisible to per-layer parses. Every segment was tagged `tool_index=0` and resolved to `palette[0]`. On a Voron + AFC setup with black ASA in lane 1 and a print sliced to T3 (white PLA), this manifested as a solid-black render that looked like *no color applied* but was really *every segment tagged with the wrong tool*. `GCodeLayerIndex::build_from_file` now records the first standalone T-command during its single-pass scan; `GCodeParser::set_active_tool_index()` seeds the parser before each per-layer parse; and the `extruder_colour` single-color fallback now uses the initial tool's color instead of `palette[0]`. Also drops the `!= 0x000000` clobber in `apply_ams_tool_colors` that was wrongly treating legitimately-black filament as *unset*.
- **KIAUH extension index** — KIAUH 6.2.x added *Klipper Adaptive Meshing Purging* at index 14, so the helixscreen extension was skipped with a duplicate-index warning on load. Bumped to 15, then to 99 to dodge any further upstream collisions.
- **KIAUH update / remove now finds the installed binary** — `find_install_dir()` only probed `<dir>/helix-screen`, but releases ship the binary at `<dir>/bin/helix-screen`, so update and remove always reported *helixscreen not installed* on a working install. Probes the release path first, falls back to the top-level for any pre-1.0 layout.

### Changed

- **Installer flag: `--skip-kiauh-registration` replaces `--kiauh yes|no`** — the old flag read awkwardly when KIAUH passed `--kiauh no` to invoke install.sh. Single boolean is cleaner. `install_kiauh_extension` is also now idempotent: when target files match the source byte-for-byte, it logs *already up to date* and preserves mtimes instead of needlessly rewriting files KIAUH already owns at the right version. Bats test added for the no-op path.

## [0.99.56] - 2026-05-06

The headline is the **structural fix** for the cluster:pstat-async-delete crash family — v0.99.55 already closed the render-thread half (#929), and v0.99.56 closes the other: an **array-backed event stack** that replaces LVGL's linked-list `event_head` with a global array, eliminating the wild-pointer dereference path that's been the dominant production crash signature for weeks (#793/#840/#871/#878/#880/#906). Plus a defensive NULL-guard layer on `lv_obj_event.c` for the new VHTR49QJ signature, and a suppress-the-dialog fix for truncated crash files that were generating useless bundle submissions. Round it out with a **K2 phase-tracker fix** that stops mis-flagging BED_MESH on profile-load echoes, a **theme-init DPI fix** for BTT CB1 / sun4i framebuffers reporting bogus `width_mm`, and a **label-printer font-fit fix** for longer vendor strings on continuous tape.

### Fixed

- **Array-backed LVGL event stack (#907 — cluster:pstat-async-delete structural fix)** — `lv_event_mark_deleted` previously walked a linked list of stack-allocated `lv_event_t` via `e->prev` pointers chained through `event_head`. Any frame returning without popping (exception unwind, control-flow bug) stranded a stack pointer that the next walk would dereference, often after heap reuse had written ASCII bytes over it — the dominant crash signature in #793/#840/#871/#878/#880/#906. The chain is now a fixed `lv_event_t * event_stack[256]` in `_lv_global_t`; mark_deleted iterates the array and never dereferences `e->prev`. Per-slot stack-bounds + alignment validation (inherited from the v0.99.54 dispatch-depth-guard work) catches any remaining stomp into the array. Also consolidates the file-static `event_dispatch_depth` into `_lv_global_t::event_depth` so post-mortem heap snapshots can read it.
- **NULL-guards on `lv_obj_event.c` accessors (VHTR49QJ defense)** — `lv_obj_get_event_count`, `lv_obj_get_event_dsc`, `lv_obj_remove_event`, `lv_obj_remove_event_dsc`, `lv_obj_remove_event_cb`, and `lv_obj_remove_event_cb_with_user_data` all had release-mode `LV_ASSERT_NULL` (a no-op) on the obj argument. Bundle VHTR49QJ (v0.99.53/ad5x, 2026-05-04) crashed with `fault_addr=0x0` reaching the field load via a deferred async callback that didn't validate widget lifetime. Replace the ASSERT with a runtime check that bails to a sane return value and surfaces telemetry — matches the established `lvgl_observer_null_guards` pattern.
- **Suppress crash dialog for unparseable crash files (CHUQCNAE)** — bundle CHUQCNAE shipped a `crash.txt` containing only `signal:\n` after the signal handler was killed mid-write (OOM / watchdog / power loss). Application::run was still showing the crash report dialog and letting the user submit a useless empty bundle. Now consumes the file and skips the dialog when `read_crash_file` returns null. Regression test pins the contract.
- **K2 phase tracker no longer false-fires BED_MESH on profile load** — K2 `PRINT_START` emits `BED_MESH_PROFILE LOAD="default"` early in pre-print to reuse the saved mesh (no calibration). The profile's BED_MESH regex matched these echoes and falsely transitioned to BED_MESH for several seconds before HEATING_BED took over. Reduces the alternation to `BED_MESH_CALIBRATE` (still covers `BED_MESH_CALIBRATE_START_PRINT`). Also drops three dead profile entries that logged warnings on every load (signal_format with `pattern` instead of `prefix`; HEATING_CHAMBER and LOADING_FILAMENT response patterns referencing phases not in the `PrintStartPhase` enum).
- **TempGraphWidget null-config crash on legacy home-panel layouts** — `set_config` was reading `config.value("follow_overlay", false)` without guarding against JSON null. Layouts saved before v0.99.54 omit `"config"` and `parse_widget_array` hands a default-constructed (= JSON null) config to widgets, throwing `json::type_error::306` from `HomePanel::finalize_setup`. The throw escaped `run()` before v0.99.55's main_loop catch could absorb it, exiting 134. Reported by d0u8l3m, who originally requested the follow-overlay feature.
- **Theme DPI defaults to LV_DPI_DEF on bogus width_mm reports** — on BTT CB1 (sun4i-drmdrmfb) the kernel reports the 800×480 panel as 890mm × 500mm (off by ~6×), making LVGL compute DPI=23. With sub-160 DPI, `LV_DPX_CALC` clamps `PAD_SMALL` to 1px, collapsing dropdown/input padding. Now forces `lv_display_set_dpi(disp, args.dpi > 0 ? args.dpi : LV_DPI_DEF)` before theme init so widget padding survives garbage display metadata. The existing `if(width > 0)` guard in `lv_linux_fbdev.c` only catches drivers that admit ignorance, not drivers that lie.
- **Continuous-tape label fonts shrink to fit longer vendor strings** — vendor names like PRUSAMENT / POLYMAKER were truncating on 62mm tape. Drops phantom `avail_h` from 300 to 260 (STANDARD scale becomes lg=5 / md=4 / sm=3, was 6/5/4), tightens the horizontal-fit floor from 4 to 8 chars, and applies the narrow-tape margin/QR shrink to 29mm and 38mm continuous (was die-cut only).

## [0.99.55] - 2026-05-06

v0.99.54 shipped a regression and a returning crash signature; v0.99.55 closes both. The bigger story is the **Klipper error UX overhaul** — gcode errors used to surface as raw debug text like *retrude error, retrude but not trigger buffer empty limit*; now they map through a friendly-message table with a one-tap recovery path that tries the K2's deeper `helix_recover` shell_command before falling back to `firmware_restart`. Pairs with a busybox `/sbin/reboot` fallback that finally lets the shutdown widget actually work on K2/AD5M/CC1/K1C/SonicPad. Plus a **pre-print phase tracker** that turns the K2's generic 5-minute *starting print* spinner into BED_MESH / HEATING / FILAMENT_LOAD / PURGE phase progress, and a long-overdue **installer fix** that ships the KIAUH extension in the tarball (silently broken since v0.99.34).

### Added

- **Friendly Klipper error toasts with one-tap recovery** — Klipper emits errors as JSON like `{"code":"key851","msg":"retrude error..."}` where `msg` is raw debug log text. The pipeline now extracts the `code`, looks up a friendly message+hint via `CfsErrorDecoder::lookup_message()`, and routes recovery through `PrinterRecoveryService` — which tries the K2's `helix_recover` `[shell_command]` (bouncing the klipper_mcu daemon) before falling back to `printer.firmware_restart`. C++ stays platform-blind: each platform installs its own snippet via `scripts/lib/installer/recovery.sh`. key851 now displays as *Retract didn't reach buffer empty limit* instead of the raw debug string.
- **CFS error toasts include unit/slot locator** — JSON `values` arrays (e.g. `[1,"B"]` for a key849 retract failure) are stringified into a human locator and appended, so users see *which* CFS slot failed.
- **Pre-print phase tracker (K2/CFS)** — `PrintPhaseTracker` exposes coarse pre-print phases (BED_MESH, HEATING, FILAMENT_LOAD, PURGE) as LVGL subjects, replacing the generic *starting print* spinner that left K2 users staring through ~5 min of bed-mesh + heating. Inputs: `print_stats.state` plus the `notify_gcode_response` tag stream (`// [PRTOUCH_MOVE]`, `// [PROBE_STEP_INFO]`, `// [G29_TIME]`, `// [box]`). Per-firmware-family matchers — adding Bambu/RatOS/K1 variants is a sibling matcher, no parser surgery. Mirrored into the legacy `print_start_phase` / `print_start_message` / `print_start_progress` subjects so the existing `preparing_overlay` UI shows the progression with no panel rewire.
- **Shutdown/reboot widget works on busybox/procd hosts** — `SystemPower::reboot_local()` and `shutdown_local()` now fall through from logind/systemctl to `/sbin/reboot` and `/sbin/poweroff`. K2/AD5M/CC1/K1C/SonicPad shutdown buttons now actually do something (procd's sysinit hook handles graceful service teardown on those calls).

### Fixed

- **Crash loop on v0.99.54 startup** (#931) — `Application::main_loop()` now wraps each iteration in `try/catch`. When a callback throws, the type and `what()` are logged, the recent breadcrumb ring is dumped to stderr (so the next user log captures the throw site), telemetry records the event, and the loop continues with a user-facing error toast. A runaway counter (5 catches in 30s) breaks out cleanly to avoid a tight throw-catch loop. Removes the watchdog's *HelixScreen Keeps Crashing* path for any callback throw that previously exited 134.
- **MoonrakerRequestTracker error-callback path** — symmetrized exception handling: `route_response()` already absorbed throws from success callbacks, but error callbacks were unwrapped. A throwing `error_cb` now logs and continues (matching the success path).
- **Render-thread UAF in argb8888_image_blend** (#929, cluster:pstat-async-delete Mechanism B) — `GCodeLayerRenderer::destroy_cache()` / `destroy_ghost_cache()` / `destroy_ssao_cache()` and `GCodeGLESRenderer::~GCodeGLESRenderer()` (plus the resize-time recreate path) all now call `lv_draw_wait_for_finish()` before `lv_draw_buf_destroy()`. The parallel render thread reads `dsc.src` after `lv_draw_image()` returns; freeing the buffer while a draw task was still in flight unmapped the source page and segfaulted in `argb8888_image_blend`. The wait drains pending tasks before the buffer goes away. Single-threaded builds (`LV_USE_OS == 0`) are unaffected — `lv_draw_wait_for_finish` is a no-op there.
- **CFS load no longer transitions to IDLE prematurely** — `AmsBackendCfs` was flipping `action=IDLE` the moment the toolhead extruder `filament_switch_sensor` triggered, but the K2 load script has 5 steps (CR_BOX_PRE_OPT → EXTRUDE → WASTE → FLUSH → END_OPT) and the sensor trips at the END of step 2. The remaining WASTE + FLUSH (~109 mm at 240 °C, ~3 min) ran while the UI told the user the load was idle. IDLE now defers to script completion, and the toolhead is parked during load.
- **No more execute_gcode spam while Klipper is halted** — with `klippy_state=ERROR` after a key298 rpi-MCU shutdown, wiggling the fan slider previously fired ~30 M106 commands per tick that Klipper rejected on each attempt. Now refuses early when state is SHUTDOWN or ERROR; recovery RPCs (`firmware_restart`, `emergency_stop`, `shell_command`) are unaffected.
- **Phase tracker forward-only ordering** — K2 `[PROBE_STEP_INFO]` (mesh probing) and `[WHY_DEBUG]target_temp` (heating) interleave during early mesh because bed heat ramps in parallel; the tracker no longer flips back from HEATING → BED_MESH on the late probe lines.
- **Phase tracker maps PRINTING → IDLE for legacy overlay** — the legacy `preparing_overlay` panel observer treats any non-IDLE `PrintStartPhase` as *still preparing*; mapping PRINTING → COMPLETE was leaving the overlay stuck up for the rest of the print.
- **Print-start no longer enters BED_MESH from QGL/Z_TILT probe lines** — Voron 2.4 PRINT_START runs QGL before BED_MESH_CALIBRATE. QGL probes 4 corner pads with `samples=3` = 12 *probe at X,Y* lines, which tripped the collector's `MESH_PROBE_ENTRY_THRESHOLD=3` and mis-promoted the phase to BED_MESH (off-by-12 probe count, QGL phase invisible). Collector now ignores probe lines until BED_MESH is announced.
- **Installer KIAUH extension actually ships in the tarball** — silently broken since v0.99.34: release tarballs (built by `mk/cross.mk`) never copied `scripts/kiauh/` into the package, so `install_kiauh_extension()` always hit *source files not found* and bailed. Now copied into all 10 platform release targets. Also closes a PII leak — release tarballs were shipping any `telemetry_*.json`, `tool_spools.json`, `crash_report.txt` present in the dev tree (only `settings.json`/`helixconfig*.json` were stripped). And collapsed the longstanding drift between `install-dev.sh` and the bundler's MAIN heredoc into `scripts/lib/installer/main.sh` (sourced by both, install-dev.sh shrinks 295→48 lines).
- **Documentation gallery images render on github.com** (#928) — `GALLERY.md` lives at `docs/devel/` but images live at `docs/images/`; the bare `images/` refs resolved to a non-existent `docs/devel/images/`. Reported by @TMTYD.

### Changed

- **PrintPhaseTracker unified into PrintStartCollector** — internal refactor consolidating the two pre-print tracking surfaces into a single owner.
- **Keyboard per-release event log demoted to trace** — was cluttering `-vv` debug output during normal typing.

## [0.99.54] - 2026-05-04

The follow-up to last week's hotfix. Headline pieces: the **L081 unwind-safe `lv_event_pop`** fix that landed eleven hours after v0.99.53 tagged (so it missed that release), plus a second layer of defensive guards in `lv_event_mark_deleted` for the **cluster:pstat-async-delete** crash family (#906) that's been the dominant production signature since 4/29. The **pre-print options framework** lands across four phases — a uniform contract for every per-printer pre-print Klipper option (K2 Plus AI detect, K1C/SonicPad bed leveling, etc.) replacing the old ad-hoc per-option JSON. Round it out with **in-place fan-carousel dial drag** (no more popping a separate fan-control overlay), **AD5X-IFS hardening** (stale plugin data, custom materials, lane-data sync on external CHANGE_ZCOLOR), the long-pending **L083 std::thread audit** wrapping every remaining bare detached spawn, and a **memory-leak fix** for AMS detail panel.

### Added

- **In-place fan-speed control** — drag the arc on a fan card in the Controls fan carousel to change the speed directly. No more bouncing into a separate fan-control overlay for the common case.
- **"Follow my graph selection" toggle on the temperature-graph card** — when on, dragging through the time axis pins the readout to the touched sample instead of always tracking live.
- **Pre-print options framework (Phases 1-4)** — every per-printer pre-print option (K2 Plus AI detect, bed leveling, calibration prompts, etc.) now flows through a uniform `PrePrintOption` contract. Phase 1 introduced the framework, Phase 2 migrated the JSON DB and all call sites, Phase 3 rebuilt the UI to generate rows dynamically with category subheaders, Phase 4 added K2 Plus `ai_detect` via the `PreStartGcode` strategy.
- **moonraker-timelapse component detection** (#926) — the Settings row appears for users with a pre-existing moonraker-timelapse install (MainsailOS, manual config), not just those who ran the in-app install wizard.
- **Favorite-macro home-screen tap honors safety settings** (#925) — dangerous-macro confirmation prompts now fire from the home-screen tap path the same way they do from the macros panel.
- **Debug bundle now captures platform config files + CFS Klipper objects** — bundles for K2 / Pi printers carry the full Klipper objects payload for CFS units.

### Fixed

- **LVGL event-dispatch unwind safety (L081 root cause)** — when a C++ exception unwinds through `lv_obj_send_event` or `lv_event_push_and_send`, the explicit `lv_event_pop` was being skipped, leaving `event_head` pointing at a defunct stack frame. The next `lv_event_mark_deleted` walk SIGBUSed reading garbage. Patched both entry points to use GCC `__attribute__((cleanup))` (with `-fexceptions` enabled on LVGL TUs) so pop fires on exception unwinds too. Closes the design gap behind crash families #793/#840/#871/#878/#880 and a substantial fraction of the cluster:pstat-async-delete (#906) hits.
- **Cluster:pstat-async-delete defensive guards (#906)** — `lv_event_mark_deleted` now layers two additional checks: a dispatch-depth coherence guard (logs `event_head_stale_leak` anomaly if `event_head` is non-NULL with no active send frame) and a stack-bounds check (logs `event_head_stack_oob` if the chain pointer is outside the current thread's stack range). Both reset `event_head` and bail safely. Catches corruption modes the cleanup-attribute path can't address (heap reuse, memory stomp). Plus per-step breadcrumbs in `PrintStatusPanel::on_activate` so the next field crash names which step set up the corruption. Breadcrumb ring expanded 128→256 to keep async_d/sync_d entries from rotating off.
- **L083 thread spawn audit completes** — every remaining bare `std::thread(...).detach()` site is now wrapped in try/catch surfacing a toast on `std::system_error` from `pthread_create` EAGAIN. Prevents `std::terminate` aborts under thread exhaustion on resource-constrained ARM (AD5M, K1C, MIPS targets).
- **AD5X-IFS stale plugin data + custom materials** (#904) — Adventurer5M.json reads now guard against stale lessWaste/bambufy `save_variables` rows that persist after plugin uninstall, and user-defined materials in `/mod_data/user.cfg` now surface in the slot picker alongside built-ins.
- **AD5X-IFS sync on external CHANGE_ZCOLOR** — when the user runs `CHANGE_ZCOLOR` from Mainsail/Fluidd or the AD5X touchscreen, HelixScreen now syncs `lane_data` and `_IFS_VARS` to match instead of drifting out of agreement.
- **AD5X auto-detect on ZMOD firmware** — was misdetected as AD5M Pro on certain ZMOD revisions.
- **AMS detail panel destroyed on close** — was holding ~MB of widget state for the lifetime of the app.
- **AMS bypass spool position** — pinned to the canvas tube line on size-changed events instead of drifting on resize.
- **AD5X-IFS post-print runout toast suppression** — was firing every print-end since the IFS auto-unloads after the job; now only triggers on real runout.
- **Thermistor widget rebinds temp observer when sensor name changes** (#916) — the bound subject is dynamic; the widget now uses a paired `SubjectLifetime` member so observer cleanup matches the dynamic-subject pattern.
- **Fan-carousel arc value-changed no longer records spurious interactions** — the auto-debounce was treating programmatic arc updates as user input.
- **FilamentConsumptionTracker stopped before `destroy_all` on shutdown** (#927) — closes a use-after-free observed during AD5X tear-down.
- **Print Select self-heals stuck refresh_in_flight_ flag after 30s** — a never-arriving file-list response could lock out subsequent refreshes; a watchdog now clears the flag.
- **Splash process orphaned on DRM platforms (Snapmaker U1)** — `helixscreen.init` starts `helix-splash` early before the display backend is selected, but `helix-watchdog`'s "skip external splash on DRM" branch (added because fbdev splash mmap conflicts with DRM) only avoided spawning a *new* splash; the externally-adopted PID was silently dropped, never forwarded to helix-screen via `--splash-pid`, and never reaped. Splash kept running after the UI took over the display, burning ~60% CPU on a single core forever (rockchipdrmfb's fbdev compat layer kept it from failing). Watchdog now reaps the orphan when DRM is selected. Belt-and-suspenders: `cleanup_splash` escalates to SIGKILL after a 600 ms SIGTERM grace, and the splash binary self-exits after 30 s if no signal arrives.
- **Moonraker component-capability flags cleared on each discovery** — stale capability bits from a prior connection no longer leak into a new printer's profile.
- **Favorite-macro context leak on backdrop/ESC dismiss + i18n confirm body** (#925) — the ButtonCallbackData was leaking when the picker was dismissed via backdrop tap or ESC.
- **Macros-panel dangerous-macro confirm body** — i18n keys hooked up and the body text formatted for readability.

### Changed

- **Color swatches and filament-mapping cards driven by subjects** — converted from imperative C++ visibility toggles to declarative XML `bind_flag_if_eq` against a subject. Removes the last `can_show_*` zombie subjects from `printer_state.cpp`.
- **Debug bundle HTTP fetch + sanitization factored out**; `user.cfg` redaction fixed (was leaking certain custom-material entries verbatim).
- **AD5X re-reads `Adventurer5M.json` on AMS detail-view entry** — picks up out-of-band edits from the AD5X firmware native UI without requiring a HelixScreen restart.

## [0.99.53] - 2026-04-28

A hotfix release. The headline fix: **v0.99.51 and v0.99.52 could brick AD5X stock-ZMOD printers** by corrupting `Adventurer5M.json` to zero bytes through a Moonraker upload that crossed mount boundaries. On the next firmware restart, Klipper's zmod_color.py couldn't parse the empty file and never finished `connect` — recovery required SSH. Both releases have been pulled from the GitHub release feed; v0.99.53 ships the corrected write path. While we were here, this release also lands the per-printer gcode console filter system, OrcaSlicer-compatible bed/nozzle temperature emission to `lane_data` slot records, and a small theme polish.

### Added
- **Per-printer gcode console filter** — every printer can have its own customizable filter list for the gcode console panel. Settings overlay lets you add/remove patterns and toggle the filter on/off without rebooting; defaults are seeded from the printer database so common boilerplate (heartbeat polls, M105 noise) is suppressed out of the box.
- **OrcaSlicer-compatible bed/nozzle temperatures in `lane_data`** — HelixScreen now emits `bed_temp` and `nozzle_temp` on every filament-slot save so OrcaSlicer 2.3.2+ can sync them to its filament presets. Source priority: explicit user entry > bound Spoolman spool's profile > internal material database default. Spec docs bumped to v1.1.

### Fixed
- **AD5X stock-ZMOD bricked at boot from corrupted Adventurer5M.json** — v0.99.51 switched IFS color/material persistence from `CHANGE_ZCOLOR` (which pops a Mainsail/Fluidd "Select print materials" prompt on every edit) to a Moonraker HTTP upload of `Adventurer5M.json`. On AD5X stock-ZMOD, `/root/printer_data/tmp/` and `/usr/prog/config/` are on different mounts and Moonraker's config root entry symlinks across them; the upload's `os.rename(tmp → dest)` throws `EXDEV` and the destination ends up empty. On the next firmware restart, zmod_color.py's `json.load(file)` raised `JSONDecodeError`, klippy never finished `connect`, and the printer was unrecoverable without SSH. Bundle DQK7X96B and DIEHARDave's report on Discord. Fix: when helix-screen runs on the same host as Moonraker (the typical install), skip the upload and write `Adventurer5M.json` directly via filesystem APIs with an atomic temp-then-rename inside the destination directory. The Moonraker upload path remains as a fallback for remote/screen-only installs that genuinely aren't on the same machine.
- **ActionPromptModal footer divider used hardcoded color** — switched to the border design token so it tracks theme.

## [0.99.52] - 2026-04-28

A bug fix release dominated by killing a class of crash loops triggered by Moonraker subscription-restricted JSON nulls. Klipper objects don't always implement every field a subscription names; Moonraker faithfully delivers `null` for the missing ones, and several of our parsers were calling `.get<T>()` straight through, throwing `type_error.302` and unwinding into `main()`'s top-level catch (exit 134). Every restart hit the same bug, and the watchdog couldn't break out. Now: every parser type-guards before extracting, the dispatch path absorbs callback throws so one rogue parser can't take down the others, a CI lint gate fails any new violation, and the watchdog detects same-signature crash loops (≥3 in 90s) and offers a Safe Mode boot that defers the Moonraker connection so the user can reach Settings.

### Added
- **Watchdog Safe Mode boot** — when the same crash signature repeats 3+ times in 90s (typical of a deterministic state-driven crash), the recovery dialog switches to a loop-aware variant with the auto-restart countdown disabled and "Safe Mode" as the primary button. Picking it writes a one-shot marker, restarts the app, and Application defers the Moonraker connection on the next launch with a sticky banner. A clean reboot exits Safe Mode automatically.

### Fixed
- **Subscription-restricted-null crash loops** — Moonraker delivers `null` for subscribed fields the underlying Klipper object lacks (Snapmaker U1's `filament_motion_sensor.detection_count` is the prototypical case). Multiple parsers used unguarded `.get<T>()` that threw `json::type_error::302` on null, unwinding past the dispatch loop and exiting 134. Hardened `printer_state.update_from_notification`, `printer_print_state.update_from_status`, sensor parsers, `led_controller` color channels, and `filament_sensor`. The initial-subscription apply path (`MoonrakerClient::dispatch_status_update`) now also wraps each callback in try/catch so one throwing parser can't take down the rest. A CI lint gate (`scripts/check_subscription_null_safety.py`) prevents regressions.
- **AD5X panel widget rebuilds could abort under memory pressure** — the panel widget manager allocated a small `AsyncCtx` struct per gate-observer firing and queued it via `lv_async_call`. On memory-tight AD5X (~107MB RAM) a `std::bad_alloc` here propagated through LVGL's C event-dispatch frame and aborted the process via `std::terminate`, surfacing as unrelated-looking crashes (L083 family). Now uses a stable per-panel slot stored in the manager singleton — no per-firing allocation in the hot path.
- **AD5X IFS slot overrides wiped on boot** — on startup, `parse_save_variables` ran `update_slot_from_state` for every slot before `Adventurer5M.json` had been fetched. With no firmware color reading yet, the swap-detection helper saw the `SlotInfo` default (0x808080 gray) as the baseline; seconds later when the real color landed it was misread as a "physical spool swap" and the user's override was cleared (brand, spoolman_id, weights, material). On the next boot 0 overrides loaded because boot 1 had wiped them. raza616 caught the symptom: PETG slot flipping back to firmware-truth PLA on every power cycle. Fix: treat empty `colors_[idx]` as a no-signal reading so the baseline is only established from real firmware data. Bundle AQ6DALWG.
- **AD5X IFS: stale lessWaste/bambufy save_variables ignored after plugin uninstall** — `parse_save_variables` was reading `<prefix>_tools` / `_current_tool` / `_external` unconditionally whenever the keys were present. Moonraker's `save_variables` rows persist in `printer_data/database/` long after a plugin uninstall removes the gcode macro, so a user who removed lessWaste/bambufy would silently keep using the dead plugin's last tool map and active-tool guess on every boot. Now those reads are gated on `has_ifs_vars_` (= macro confirmed loaded), matching the contract the latch already advertised.
- **G-code viewer renderer stalls now recover instead of going blank** — added a renderer-stall watchdog with cache-state logging; on detected stall the viewer reinitialises rather than freezing on a blank or partial render.
- **Niimbot B1 cancelled print before the printer started moving** — the BLE PrintEnd packet was being treated as job-finished too early; now we wait for actual motion before allowing the cancel path to close the job.
- **AD5X stock ZMOD: GET_ZCOLOR spam quieted** — the ZMOD slot poller was firing the macro every tick instead of only on JSON content change. Now polls the JSON contents and only emits the macro when something changed.
- **AD5X installer refuses to run outside ZMOD chroot** — preflight now bails with a clear error rather than silently corrupting a non-ZMOD AD5X install.
- **Snapmaker U1 install: self-heal stale S99screen patches** — old patched init scripts from prior installs are detected and replaced rather than skipped.
- **ALSA buffer-underrun spam on Pi** — continuous underrun warnings during sound playback were burning log volume; the underrun path now backs off cleanly.
- **Label printer: faster BlueZ unpair + truthful Forget toast** — the Forget action would hang on BlueZ's slow unpair, then toast success even when the unpair had failed. Now uses a faster path and surfaces real status.

### Changed
- **Debug bundle exposes canonical platform_model** — bundles now include `printer.platform_model` (derived from the build-time platform key) alongside the user-picked `printer.model`, plus a `platform_model_mismatch` flag when they disagree. Lets the triage dashboard surface AD5X-running-as-AD5M-Pro mismatches without trusting the wizard pick blindly.
- **Shutdown observer-release contract test generalised** — the structural check that caught #888 is now table-driven; new singletons destroyed after `StaticSubjectRegistry::deinit_all()` can be added with one row.

## [0.99.51] - 2026-04-28

A targeted fix release. K2 install path works end-to-end now: a procd shim makes the autostart actually fire (devices were sitting at the boot logo on fresh install), uninstall re-enables Creality's stock UI, and a 68s boot trim gets K2 Plus into HelixScreen in ~36s. AD5X stock-ZMOD users get IFS active-slot tracking via GET_ZCOLOR, and slot edits no longer pop Mainsail/Fluidd "Select print materials" prompts or native touchscreen confirmation dialogs on every sync.

### Fixed
- **K2 install autostart never fired** — K2 (Tina Linux / OpenWrt procd) silently skips plain SysV init scripts at boot; procd's iterator only invokes scripts with both the rc.common shebang and a DEPEND directive. Our shared S99helixscreen had neither. Install now writes a procd-compatible shim at `/etc/init.d/helixscreen` that delegates to S99helixscreen, so K2 (Pro/Plus/Max) actually starts HelixScreen at boot instead of sitting at the boot logo. Reported by jacekruf (K2 Pro, F012 board).
- **K2 uninstall left device with no UI** — `hooks-k2.sh` runs `/etc/init.d/app disable` on every helix-screen launch (suppressing the stock procd-managed UI), but the modular uninstaller had no K2 case to re-enable it. Devices booted into the Creality logo with no UI after uninstall. Now enable+start runs against `/etc/init.d/app` on K2 series.
- **AD5X stock ZMOD: active loaded slot not tracked** — `parse_zcolor_silent()` correctly extracted `extruder_slot` from GET_ZCOLOR but `apply_zcolor_result()` dropped the field. For users without lessWaste, `active_tool_` stayed at -1 forever and the panel showed stale slot info on unload. Now derived from `extruder_slot` when no IFS vars are present. Reported by raza616.
- **AD5X stock ZMOD: every slot edit popped two dialogs** — `CHANGE_ZCOLOR` always emits a Mainsail/Fluidd "Select print materials" prompt and (on `display=True` setups) an HTTP-driven confirmation dialog on the native AD5X touchscreen. Both fired every time HelixScreen synced a slot — QR scans, Spoolman pulls, tool-mapping changes. Now writes `Adventurer5M.json` directly (zmod's source of truth) and only fires `_IFS_VARS` for lessWaste users. Confirmed by DIEHARDave.

### Changed
- **K2 boot time trimmed by 68s** — empirical traces on the dev K2 Plus showed `platform_wait_for_services` was treating its 30 timeout as iteration count (not seconds) and `platform_pre_start`'s WiFi association ran synchronously. Now: timeout tracks wall time via `date +%s` and the wpa_supplicant + udhcpc dance is backgrounded. K2 Plus fresh boot: 104s → 36s; most of the remaining 30s is honoring the service-wait budget while Moonraker comes up.
- **i18n** — upgrade banner and shutdown-modal Reboot/Shutdown buttons newly tagged for translation; 15 strings translated across de, es, fr, it, ja, pt, ru, zh. All locales now at 100% coverage (1940/1940).
- **Settings: printer host description binding** — moved from imperative C++ (`lv_obj_find_by_name` + `lv_label_bind_text`) to declarative `bind_description` attribute, aligning with the project's "DATA in C++, APPEARANCE in XML" rule. Internal cleanup; no behavior change.

## [0.99.50] - 2026-04-27

A perf and stability patch. Headlines: animated screensaver now defaults to Off on BASIC (Pi 3B-class) and EMBEDDED (AD5M / AD5X) tiers to keep the CPU out of Klipper's print loop, with a one-time migration notice and reduced frame rate when users re-enable on those tiers; another sweep of L081-family teardown crashes (`lv_event_mark_deleted`); plus targeted fixes for AD5X IFS color sync, AFC `LANE_UNLOAD` serialization, and the Z-offset probe sequence. Re-tagged after the initial CI release build broke on cross-compile targets and a SonicPad user reported the shutdown widget was unreachable when Moonraker failed to connect.

### Fixed
- **Release build broken on cross-compile targets** — the v15→v16 screensaver migration referenced `PlatformCapabilities::detect()` and `platform_tier_to_string()` unconditionally in `config.cpp`. Those symbols ship in helix-screen but not in `helix-splash` / `helix-watchdog`'s extra-obj lists, so every cross-compile target (pi32, ad5m, etc.) failed at link time on the auxiliary binaries. Both call sites are now gated behind the existing `HELIX_SPLASH_ONLY` / `HELIX_WATCHDOG` guard — splash/watchdog don't render the screensaver and treat the migration as a no-op.
- **Shutdown widget unusable when Moonraker can't be reached** — feedback from a SonicPad user: when Klipper failed to boot, the WebSocket never connected and the shutdown button stayed disabled, leaving the hardware switch as the only way to power off. The button is now always clickable; in same-host single-scope mode (helix-screen and Moonraker on the same device) the buttons fall back to `SystemPower::shutdown_local()` / `reboot_local()` (logind → systemctl) when the RPC isn't available. Dual-scope users on a remote screen already had a Screen-only path; ungating the button makes it reachable when the printer is unresponsive.
- **K1C boot logo persisted on SimpleAF firmware** ([#890]) — `boot_display` was only killed when `/etc/init.d/S99start_app` existed, but SimpleAF removes that script while keeping `S12boot_display` in place. The Creality boot logo now stops on all K1 firmware variants when HelixScreen takes over.
- **AD5X identify-wizard sleep regression** — removed the wizard block that force-wrote stale pre-#431 display values on every confirmation. New v14→v15 config migration restores the AD5X backlight-off sleep preset for users polluted by the pre-fix wizard. Resolves the "random RGB colors during sleep" symptom documented in `FLASHFORGE_AD5X_SUPPORT.md`.
- **AD5X IFS color and material type sync** — slot color/type changes from the panel now use Flashforge's `CHANGE_ZCOLOR` macro so the IFS controller actually receives the update.
- **AFC `LANE_UNLOAD` requests are now serialized** — tapping Eject on multiple lanes in quick succession queues the requests and runs them one-at-a-time instead of overlapping AFC macros. Mitigates Turtle_1 "Timer too close" shutdowns from competing stepper / LED-animation work.
- **Shutdown crash with active observer chains** ([#893]) — `Application::shutdown()` now invalidates `ObserverGuard`s *before* tearing down `MoonrakerManager`. The prior teardown order let pending subject notifications fire callbacks against destroyed Moonraker state, producing L081-family crashes during exit.
- **`MoonrakerManager::m_print_duration_observer` not released on shutdown** ([#888]) — observer lingered through the static destructor chain; explicit release on shutdown closes the dangling-observer window.
- **Temp graph chart deletion now async** ([#867]) — chart child cleanup during temp-graph teardown moved off the synchronous LVGL event-list iteration path, with breadcrumb logging for any remaining anomalies.
- **L081 family: panel gate observer rebuilds coalesced via `lv_async_call`** — multiple gate-state subject changes within a single tick now produce one rebuild instead of N synchronous rebuilds, eliminating the multi-sync-delete-per-tick pattern that corrupts LVGL's global event linked list.
- **Z-offset wizard no longer auto-prefixes `CLEAN_NOZZLE` to `PROBE_CALIBRATE`** — the auto-prefix fired on printers without a wipe macro, hanging the calibration sequence. Users with a wipe macro can wire it into their start gcode.

### Changed
- **Animated screensaver disabled by default on BASIC and EMBEDDED tiers** — Raspberry Pi 3B-class (BASIC) and AD5M / AD5X (EMBEDDED) hardware now ship with the screensaver off to prevent print failures from CPU contention with Klipper. Users upgrading with Flying Toasters still enabled on these tiers are migrated to Off with a one-time notification; the setting can be re-enabled under Settings → Display. When re-enabled on these tiers, the screensaver runs at a reduced frame rate (~7 fps) with fewer sprites (Flying Toasters capped at 10) to stay out of the print loop's way.
- **Spool canvas scroll smoothness** — dedup pass, LRU pixel cache, and a sqrt LUT in the canvas pixel renderer. Noticeable on filament panel scroll on EMBEDDED-tier hardware.
- **Crash bundle `queue_prev` ring coalesces consecutive identical tags** — high-frequency callbacks (e.g. `TSM::update_subjects` per WebSocket tick) used to fill all four slots and bury genuinely distinct prior callbacks. The producer now bumps a parallel count on tag-pointer match instead of advancing the ring; emitted as `queue_prev: tag (xN)` when N > 1. Restores diagnostic runway for tracing post-callback heap corruption (#840 / #851 family).

## [0.99.49] - 2026-04-26

A targeted hotfix release for AD5X (ZMOD firmware) and other platforms with aggressive supervisor lifecycles. Real-time triage of bundle EE8X6GSK plus a live SSH session on the affected printer revealed a crash-loop chain combining three independent bugs: ZMOD's display-handoff Klipper macro periodically `killall`s helix-screen, our SIGTERM handler ran the full `Application::shutdown()` teardown, the teardown crashed with SIGBUS in late-stage cleanup (the crash handler was uninstalled in the first line of `shutdown()`, so no diagnostic landed on disk), and the watchdog burned through restart credits leaving a blank screen. All three sides are now hardened.

### Fixed
- **HelixScreen no longer crash-loops on platforms whose firmware aggressively respawns the UI process (AD5X / ZMOD)** — SIGTERM now triggers immediate `_exit(0)` without running `Application::shutdown()`. External supervisors only care about a clean exit code, not whether teardown ran. Skipping the fragile teardown path (LVGL deinit, observer cleanup, static destructors) avoids the L081-family SIGBUS that ZMOD's killall-and-respawn cycle was hitting on AD5X every ~20 s after Klipper restart. SIGINT (Ctrl+C from terminal) keeps the graceful shutdown path. Persisted state (settings, telemetry queue, crash history) is written on each change so nothing is lost.
- **Crash handler stays installed through the entire shutdown sequence** — `crash_handler::uninstall()` was the *first* line of `Application::shutdown()`; now the *last*. Any SIGBUS/SIGSEGV during widget deletion, observer cleanup, or `lv_deinit` is now captured to `crash.txt` instead of falling through to the kernel default with no diagnostic. Critical for surfacing the L081-family teardown crashes seen post-v0.99.46.
- **Crash diagnostics survive misconfigured config dirs (chroot, overlay, PrivateTmp)** — when the signal handler can't `open()` the primary crash path, it now falls back to writing the dump to stderr (with `=== HELIX_CRASH_DUMP ===` marker prefix). Stderr is always open and gets captured by both journald (systemd) and the watchdog's stderr pipe, so users on platforms where `$HELIX_CONFIG_DIR` resolves to a non-writable layer no longer get silent diagnostic blackouts.
- **Debug bundles now include crash data on platforms that set `$HELIX_CONFIG_DIR`** (ZMOD, RatOS, etc.) — collector previously used an ad-hoc `$HOME/helixscreen/config` probe that missed overlay installs entirely. Now uses the canonical `helix::get_user_config_dir()` resolver, matching where the crash handler writes. New `crash_txt` bundle key includes the raw signal-handler dump even when the next-boot reporter hasn't run yet.
- **Webcam discovery skipped on platforms without a camera widget** — Moonraker `server.webcams.list` and the local-endpoint probes (127.0.0.1:8080/8081/4408) now respect the `HELIX_HAS_CAMERA` compile-time gate. Skipped on AD5M/AD5X/CC1/K1/K2/MIPS/SnapmakerU1. On AD5X specifically, the firmware's kernel H.264 codec driver crashes on every `v4l2_open` (`dma_coherent_mem_available` NULL+12 deref) — we never opened `/dev/video*` directly so this isn't the trigger for the recent crash family, but probing for a webcam we can't render is wasted RPC.
- **Installer disk-check uses POSIX `head -n 1`** so BusyBox doesn't reject `head -1` (AD5M/AD5X/K1/K2).
- **Updater download-directory candidate list now includes the install root** — previously skipped install-root candidates, breaking updates on platforms where the install root is the only writable location.

## [0.99.48] - 2026-04-26

A performance and correctness patch. Headlines: drastically narrowed Moonraker subscriptions (the prior nullptr-everything pattern was firing per-frame led_effect notifications on AFC hardware — a Voron Trident bundle showed 46 LED-effect objects updating per render frame); a tangle of six interlocking fixes to the wizard preset path so AD5M Pro on ForgeX firmware actually skips hardware steps on fresh install; and a UAF / OOB-read fix for a shared-component XML callback collision caught in bundle SSHGTVZQ.

### Added
- **Jog soft-stops driven by kinematic envelope** — `MotionPanel::jog()` now refuses moves that would push the toolhead past `toolhead.axis_minimum`/`axis_maximum` and toasts the user. Skipped when bounds aren't published yet or the axis isn't homed.

### Fixed
- **Wizard preset application: AD5M Pro ForgeX skipping hardware steps on fresh install** — six interlocking issues (preset path resolution, late `preset_mode` capture, Moonraker connect gated behind wizard, validate-before-detect ordering, wrong fan names in `ad5m_*_forgex.json`, `_zmod` probe firing on `_forgex` preset, missing aux fan slot recognition).
- **Layer-source precedence within a status update** — slicer `SET_PRINT_STATS_INFO` now wins over `virtual_sdcard.layer` within the same tick (sdcard branch was running second and silently overwriting). Across updates, last source still wins.
- **`toolhead.max_velocity` subscription regression** — caught in code review of subscription narrowing; `max_velocity_` would have stuck at its initial value, breaking the print-tune overlay and machine-limits panel after every reconnect. Field list is now locked by a 19-case / 178-assertion regression test naming each parser file it mirrors.
- **XML callback name collision could SEGV on click** (bundle SSHGTVZQ, Qidi Q2, pi) — first-write-wins for `lv_xml_register_event_cb` meant two C++ owners registering the same callback name globally for a shared XML component (e.g., `WizardWifiStep` + `NetworkSettingsOverlay` on `wifi_network_item`) silently dropped the second registration. The first owner's handler then fired against the second owner's `user_data`, casting a small struct as a much larger one and reading ~400 bytes past valid memory. Now last-write-wins.

### Changed
- **Moonraker subscription narrowing — heaters, fans, sensors, tools, macros** — eliminated the remaining `nullptr` (= all-fields) subscriptions in the discovery sequence. Narrowed to the actual fields each parser consumes (heaters → `{temperature, target}`, standard fans → `{speed}`, native LEDs → `{color_data}`, etc.). Dropped `idle_timeout` entirely (no parser reads it).
- **Moonraker subscription narrowing — `led_effect`, AFC, core motion** — biggest perf win on AFC/BoxTurtle: a Voron Trident bundle showed 46 `led_effect` objects firing per-frame animation updates because we'd been subscribing with `nullptr`. Now `led_effect` is just `[enabled]`. Also narrowed all `AFC*` objects to their parser fields, and the per-step core motion objects (`toolhead`, `gcode_move`, `motion_report`).
- **Launcher `nice +10` when co-hosted with Klipper/Moonraker** — `helix-launcher.sh` reduces UI process priority on shared-CPU hardware (Pi, SonicPad, AD5M class) so the printer control loop keeps CPU headroom for stepper timing and MCU comms. Detection is process-based (`pgrep -f`) with a Unix-socket fallback. Standalone displays (remote-display SonicPad, dev workstation, kiosk pointed at a network printer) are unaffected. Override with `HELIX_NICE=<n>` in `helixscreen.env`; `HELIX_NICE=0` disables.
- **`make clean-tests` now wipes the PCH and all sanitizer test binaries** — recover from a sanitizer-contaminated tree without `make clean`. Previously, ASan/TSan test runs reused the PCH compiled with `-fsanitize=address`, and a subsequent `make test-run` would fail with "ASan runtime does not come first."

## [0.99.47] - 2026-04-26

A defensive-hardening patch release continuing the L081 (`lv_event_mark_deleted` SEGV/SIGBUS) eradication campaign begun in v0.99.45/v0.99.46. Sweeps the remaining unsafe `lv_obj_clean()` callsites that escape UpdateQueue batches, plugs lifetime gaps in two control panel callbacks, and lands a stress harness that will catch regressions of the multiple-async-delete-per-tick race plugged in v0.99.46.

### Fixed
- **L081 family (`lv_event_mark_deleted` SEGV/SIGBUS) — final sweep** ([#873]–[#878]) — 18 remaining `lv_obj_clean()` callsites that ran inside event-dispatch frames or queued callbacks were converted to `safe_clean_children()` so child deletion happens via `lv_obj_delete_async()` rather than synchronously inside an LVGL event-list iteration. Pairs with v0.99.46's wizard root-cause fix to close the #840-adjacent crash family.
- **Container child cleanup escapes event-dispatch batch** — top-level containers cleaned during input-event handling now defer child deletion to the next async tick, eliminating the multiple-sync-delete-per-tick race that corrupted LVGL's global event linked list.
- **Z-offset save and flow up/down callbacks lacked lifetime guards** — the controls panel could fire on a freed `MotionPanel` if a save/flow tap landed during teardown. All three callbacks now use `tok.defer()` with lifetime tokens, matching the rest of the panel.
- **Updater "no space" check used a hardcoded 50 MB floor** — but the current pi32 zip is 69 MB, so users could pass the precheck and fail mid-stream. The check now uses the asset size from the GitHub/R2 manifest with a 1.2× headroom and a 200 MB fallback for unknown-size assets, plus an actionable error message naming the asset and the shortfall (driven by bundle 7ZGHW5KX where systemd namespace weirdness caused statvfs to misreport free space).
- **Debug bundles missed helixscreen log on ZMOD AD5X** — log lives at `/opt/config/mod_data/log/helixscreen.log` (real path `/usr/data/config/mod_data/log/`); both are now in the log-tail cascade.
- **About panel: licenses container border radius** — was hardcoded; now uses the `#border_radius` design token so it matches the rest of the panel.

### Changed
- **action_prompt_modal show/hide stress harness** — `tests/unit/test_action_prompt_modal_stress.cpp` adds seven Catch2 variants (rapid show/hide, #877 burst pattern, alternating shapes, stacked-under-base, click-driven hide, single-tick drain, queue_update racer) tagged `[stress][action_prompt][.ui_integration]`. Will trip if the multiple-async-delete-per-tick race is reintroduced. Override iteration count via `ACTION_PROMPT_STRESS_ITERATIONS`.

## [0.99.46] - 2026-04-26

A targeted fix release. The headline is the ASAN-confirmed root-cause fix for the chronic wizard step-transition crash family that has driven roughly half a dozen patch attempts since v0.99.34. With AddressSanitizer wired into the Pi cross-build, two distinct heap-use-after-frees were caught within minutes of human interaction with the wizard — replacing weeks of victim-site whack-a-mole.

### Fixed
- **Wizard step-transition heap corruption — root cause** ([#880], [#871], [#870], [#872], [#873], [#874], [#875], [#877]) — `WizardConnectionStep::auto_probe_timer_` is a one-shot LVGL timer; LVGL deletes one-shot timers internally after the callback returns, but `attempt_auto_probe()` only nulled the member pointer on its non-early-return path. When the timer fired and early-returned (no IP yet), the member was left pointing into freed memory. On back-nav from the Connection step, `cleanup()` called `lv_timer_set_cb(nullptr)` against the freed timer, corrupting LVGL's timer linked list and the heap region behind it. Downstream effects manifested as crashes in `lv_event_mark_deleted`, `trans_anim_start_cb`, `lv_draw_sw_blend_image`, and the wider LVGL anim/event/render paths. The member is now nulled at the start of the timer callback, before any path can early-return. ASAN-confirmed.
- **Test Connection click crash** — the libhv WebSocket `onopen` lambda captured `const char* url` directly, but callers pass a stack-local `std::string`'s `.c_str()`. The lambda fires on a libhv worker thread after the caller's scope unwinds, and spdlog's format-arg processing strlen'd the freed buffer. Lambda now captures by string-copy. ASAN-confirmed.
- **Connection step IP/port pre-fill** — fields appeared empty on every visit (instead of showing 127.0.0.1/7125 or the saved config) and lost user-typed values on back/forward navigation. `init_subjects()` now seeds buffers only on first init so user input survives re-visits, and `create()` drives pre-fill from the buffer (the source of truth) rather than the subject (which can be transiently empty during XML widget construction).
- **AD5M Wi-Fi step on first launch** — Forge-X firmware doesn't auto-load the Realtek RTL8821CU USB driver, and wpa_supplicant only starts after the user has supplied credentials via the stock UI. Fresh installs running HelixScreen as the launcher therefore never enumerated `wlan0` and reported "no WiFi hardware found." Platform hooks now insmod `8821cu.ko` and start `wpa_supplicant` in `platform_pre_start()`, both idempotent. No-op on AD5M boards without a USB Wi-Fi dongle.
- **Wizard subtree purge regression** — the v0.99.45 fix to cancel style transitions during cleanup recursed into the root container and stripped its flex layout, collapsing new step content into a thin column. Root container now only gets `lv_anim_delete`; descendants still get the full style strip.
- **AMS `set_slot_info` clobbered `mapped_tool`** when the caller didn't pass it; persists across calls now. Horizontal card scrolling on the AMS panel also restored.

### Changed
- **AddressSanitizer build for Pi** — new `make pi-asan-docker` target produces a fully-instrumented binary (LVGL, helix-xml, libhv, helix-screen) with `-static-libasan` for self-contained deployment. Output to `build/pi-asan/` so it doesn't clobber regular builds. Strip is forced off; debug info is split into a separate `.debug` file kept on the build host for symbol resolution.
- **Wizard step-transition stress harness** — Catch2 fixture (`tests/unit/test_wizard_step_stress.cpp`) drives `ui_wizard_navigate_to_step` programmatically in 2↔3 bounces and full-sweep patterns, configurable via `WIZARD_STRESS_ITERATIONS`.

## [0.99.45] - 2026-04-25

A defensive-hardening release. The dominant theme is converting hard-to-debug LVGL crashes into logged anomalies that telemetry can act on, plus a scope-aware shutdown/reboot UX for users running multiple Klipper hosts.

### Added
- **Scope-aware shutdown/reboot modal** with split-button dual-host UX. When you have more than one host (e.g., a satellite Klipper running over MCU-share), the shutdown widget now lets you target Just This Printer or Both Hosts. Selecting Both chains the second action on the first host's ack; the host_identity cache is invalidated on each action so subsequent shutdowns don't bounce off stale state.
- **Label printer error toasts** — raw BlueZ / vendor error strings are now mapped to actionable toast messages ("Niimbot is busy printing — wait for the current job" instead of `org.bluez.Error.Failed: Operation already in progress`).
- **About panel: install root, config dir, cache dir rows** — pull from the new `app_globals` helpers, with a folder-home MDI glyph for the Install Root row.

### Fixed
- **L081-family LVGL crashes** ([#190], [#80], [#776], [#840], [#873]–[#878]) — `lv_event_mark_deleted` now bails defensively when `event_head` is corrupt (chain depth > 256 or pointer misaligned), reporting via `helix_lvgl_anomaly` with the head/target/depth context and a hex backtrace instead of segfaulting. Combined with the new async-delete breadcrumb hook (below), the next crash report from this family will name the widget being torn down at corruption time.
- **Markdown null-deref on tight-memory devices** ([#879]) — md4c could null-deref deep inside `md_analyze_inlines` when an internal allocation failed (observed on K1, 209 MB RAM). The observer text path now short-circuits empty/null inputs and caps input length at 256 KB before handing off to md4c.
- **Wizard step transition UAF** ([#871]) — style transitions queued by the previous step's widgets could fire `trans_anim_start_cb` on a freed widget after `lv_obj_clean`. The wizard now walks the subtree and cancels every pending animation before the clean.
- **Print Select detail view: clear thumbnail by passing nullptr** — passing the buffer pointer instead of nullptr left the image cache thinking the slot was still live.
- **Advanced panel: timelapse-setup row visibility race** — nested `bind_flag_if_eq` / `bind_flag_if_not_eq` on the same widget produced a last-one-wins race; the row is now nested inside a parent that owns the visibility binding.
- **Modal button row: danger styling now renders** — the `primary_variant` XML prop wasn't wired through, so destructive modals ("Delete profile") rendered with primary blue instead of danger red.
- **SDL sound: resize mix buffer before unpausing audio device** — fixes a transient pop / silence on the first sound after device init.
- **Bluetooth BLE-only device connect** — fall back to `ConnectProfile` when `Connect` fails on BR/EDR-less peripherals, instead of surfacing a generic "connection refused".
- **About panel: Install Root row icon** — was referencing `folder_home` which isn't in the MDI font subset; falls back to the shipped `folder` glyph.

### Changed
- **Crash-capture diagnostics** — LVGL async-delete now leaves an `async_d <class> <ptr>` breadcrumb naming the root widget being torn down (#840 diagnostic). Breadcrumb ring doubled from 64 to 128 slots, plus gated cache-eviction crumbs (#851 family). Pure diagnostics; no behavioral change.
- **i18n** — UI strings synced across 8 locales; 59 dead keys dropped from translation files.
- **Logging** — thumbnail flow is now visible at debug; the 5-second poll log is quieted.
- **CI** — stable-tag releases now dispatch a docs deploy to helixscreen-website automatically.

## [0.99.44] - 2026-04-23

### Added
- **SonicPad hardware brightness** — Creality Sonic Pad (allwinner,r818) now gets real backlight control via `/dev/disp` DISP2 ioctls. The AD5M-specific boot-time PWM-inversion reset is skipped on SonicPad, where it logged "pwm device hdl is NULL" and dragged the display pipeline.
- **Shutdown/Reboot verification** — the shutdown widget now verifies the host actually went down. Moonraker can reply `machine.shutdown`/`machine.reboot` with success but silently no-op on some firmwares (observed on SonicPad Jpe230). If the WebSocket has reconnected 20s after a successful RPC, an error toast tells the user the host is still reachable.
- **Test Screensaver button** in Settings lets you audition the selected screensaver without waiting for the dim timeout.
- **"Confirm before running" macro toggle** (Settings → Safety & Notifications, default on) gates macro execution behind a confirmation dialog. Skipped when params are required or when the macro is flagged dangerous.
- **Memory pressure responders for print status tree and LVGL image cache** — on warning+, the cached print-status widget tree (~400–800 KB) is destroyed when off the nav stack; on critical, the LVGL decoded-image cache is dropped.
- **Memory-monitor diagnostics** — pressure log lines now include our RSS/VmSize/VmSwap, 5-min growth, and system-available; on warning+ the `smaps_rollup` breakdown is dumped; a post-response summary reports the whole-app RSS delta so operators can see whether responders actually recovered memory.
- **Configurable scroll_guard cooldown** — `/input/scroll_guard_cooldown_ms` (and `HELIX_SCROLL_GUARD_COOLDOWN_MS`), clamped to 20–500 ms. Default stays 80 ms; AD5X users still seeing phantom clicks at lift-off can try 150–200 without a code change.
- **AD5X fresh installs ship the AMS widget on the home grid by default** — previously fell through to the generic default layout whose filament/AMS swap depended on `ams_slot_count` being live at wizard-completion time. Existing installs keep their saved layout.
- **Android Play Store publishing pipeline** — CI now builds and uploads signed AABs to Google Play end-to-end, gated on the Play service-account secret.
- **Contributor doc set** — CONTRIBUTOR_GOTCHAS.md, YOUR_FIRST_CONTRIBUTION.md, THEME_CONTRIBUTOR_GUIDE.md, TRANSLATION_CONTRIBUTOR_GUIDE.md, and a CONTRIBUTING.md front door at the repo root.

### Fixed
- **Text-input null-font crash** ([#853], [#864]) — `text_font` is now bound at creation time so a forced theme refresh can't land a null font pointer on the widget mid-layout.
- **Upgrade banner missing / floating "Update" + "X" buttons on every panel** — `upgrade_banner.xml` was registered with the wrong path (it lives under `ui_xml/components/`), and the banner also used an unregistered `<ui_icon>` tag that desynced the XML parser's parent stack and left the child buttons parented to the top layer. Rebuilt against theme tokens matching `toast_notification.xml`.
- **Stuck AMS widget at (-1,-1) with filament sensor occupying its cell** — a one-shot home-panel migration swaps AMS into filament's cell on any page where AMS is enabled-but-unplaced while filament is placed. Fixes existing installs caught by the `build_default_grid` timing window before the AD5X preset ship.
- **AD5M detected over AD5X when a chamber LED is present** — added `macro_exclude` on `SET_EXTRUDER_SLOT` (unique to AD5X IFS) to the four AD5M-family entries, so AD5X no longer loses the tiebreak to AD5M Pro when both fingerprints score 100.
- **AD5X IFS: ejected spool still shown as full** on the `GET_ZCOLOR` / save_variables path — mirrored the #631 eject-clear into `parse_save_variables` (only when IDLE).
- **Niimbot BLE re-pair required on every restart** — the label printer overlay's brand-based dedup mistook Niimbot's rotating BLE random address for a "wrong transport" migration and cleared the saved MAC. Same-transport duplicates are now dropped; the saved MAC sticks. Real BlueZ errors also now surface instead of "unknown error" from post-teardown reads.
- **Moonraker subscription leak across reconnects** — `lifetime_weak()` was handing `SubscriptionGuard` the same guard that `disconnect()` resets, so every reconnect looked like "client destroyed" and the real unsubscribe was skipped. Split into two guards.
- **WiFi wizard step re-entry hardening** — `apply_ethernet_status` and the deferred scan callback now early-out when the step is mid-teardown. Not a root-cause fix for the heap corruption in MCPKABEE/QLCCZKRQ, but removes a known re-entry race.
- **Print status panel "already in stack" warning spam** on long sessions — the print-start auto-push now checks `is_panel_in_stack()` before queuing.

### Changed
- **Crash-capture breadcrumbs** — finer-grained wifi-step tags (`create_enter`, `xml_create`, `scan_fire`, `populate_begin`, `cleanup_enter` under a `wifi` category), plus post-Moonraker-connect discovery and printer-identify breadcrumbs. Diagnostic only.
- **Touch-feel documentation** — CONFIGURATION.md, TROUBLESHOOTING.md, and ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLES.md now carry a symptom → setting table for `scroll_limit`, `scroll_throw`, `jitter_threshold`, and `scroll_guard`, plus a new "Unintended Clicks While Scrolling" troubleshooting entry. The docs also listed the `jitter_threshold` default as 15 (has been 5 since v2→v3); corrected along with two clamp-range typos.
- **Bluetooth setup guide** covers USB barcode scanners and USB-MCU users.

## [0.99.43] - 2026-04-22

### Added
- **Niimbot B-series support (B1 / B18 / B3S)** — added to the brand table with the shared 384-dot printhead profile. Previously these models were unsupported.
- **New label sizes** — 30×20, 30×40, 40×40, 25×30, 14×40, 14×60. Fixes **"feeds but prints blank" on B1 with 30×20 stock**, where the printer previously defaulted to a 50×30 template and advanced 50 mm of material across 2.5 of the user's actual labels per print.

### Fixed
- **Dual-mode Bluetooth label printers no longer fail to connect** — dual-mode Niimbots (D110 and siblings) enumerate as two BlueZ devices with the same name: a BR/EDR half exposing only SPP/PnP and a BLE half carrying the vendor GATT service. Discovery dedup was MAC-based, so both entries appeared in the picker and selecting the BR/EDR half always failed with `br-connection-profile-unavailable`. Dedup now resolves same-name conflicts via the brand table and keeps the vendor's preferred transport. Users whose saved pairing points at the wrong-transport sibling are auto-migrated on the next discovery (saved MAC cleared) so a single re-pair puts them on the right half.
- **"(Saved)" indicator showing on every Bluetooth device** — the saved-pair tag was flagging any device with a non-empty MAC (i.e., all of them); it now compares against the actual saved `bt_address`.
- **AD5M: crash reporter recursion on uncaught exception** — the exception record path is now async-signal-safe. When a C++ exception escaped, the crash writer recursed and the process aborted with "std::terminate without active exception" before the report could be written. Reports from AD5M devices will now arrive intact.
- **Thread exhaustion crash on small devices** ([#837]) — raw detached `std::thread(...)` sites are now routed through managed pools (`HttpExecutor::fast/slow`, `BusThread`) or wrapped in try/catch so `pthread_create` EAGAIN surfaces as a toast instead of terminating. Most visible on AD5M/CC1 under thread pressure.
- **WiFi panel use-after-free on scroll** ([#850]) — the LVGL input device is now reset before clearing the network list, closing the window where the scroll indev dereferenced a freed scrollable mid-rebuild.
- **Overlay dismiss use-after-free** ([#840]) — widget deletion in `destroy_overlay_ui` is now deferred, removing the window where a pending async callback could fire on a freed overlay.
- **Thermistor rediscover UAF** — paired `SubjectLifetime` as a member next to `ObserverGuard` so per-sensor observers expire cleanly when dynamic temperature subjects are destroyed on reconnect.
- **Observer `release()` → `reset()` in widget `LV_EVENT_DELETE` callbacks** — closes a zombie-observer class that caused rare render-state corruption behind the #579 report cluster.
- **Config: `telemetry_enabled` source-of-truth** on v13→v14 migration — resolves cases where the in-app toggle state could disagree with the stored value.
- **Crash-handler diagnostics** ([#851]) — `queue_prev` ring expanded to 4 slots for richer last-actions context; silenced an empty-name image-lookup spam path during crash capture.

### Changed
- **Toast contrast** — toast cards now sit on `elevated_bg` with a theme border, reading cleanly against busy backgrounds on all themes.
- **Printer log noise** — per-tick hot-path logs only emit on an actual state change, significantly lowering journal volume on idle devices.

## [0.99.42] - 2026-04-22

### Fixed
- **Snapmaker U1 self-update bricked on v0.99.41** — the in-app updater fell through to the Raspberry Pi tarball because `HELIX_PLATFORM_SNAPMAKER_U1` had no mapping in `get_platform_key()`. U1 devices ended up with a Pi aarch64 binary missing libsystemd/libinput/libEGL/libGLESv2/libgbm/libasound, and helix-screen failed at exec time with "cannot open shared object file". A CI guardrail now blocks any new platform from shipping without the right asset mapping. **Recovery from v0.99.41:** the broken binary can't self-update out of this bug — reinstall the Snapmaker U1 tarball manually using the instructions on the release page.

## [0.99.41] - 2026-04-21

### Added
- **Spoolman: spool lists sorted by last used** — AMS edit modal and Spoolman panel show the most recently used spool first; never-used spools sink to the bottom.

### Fixed
- **Spoolman new-spool-on-save** — the external spool modal's Save path failed to create the spool in Spoolman and never told Moonraker it was active. Density and diameter are now supplied on POST /v1/filament; initial_weight on POST /v1/spool; AmsEditModal fires sync_active_spool after create and re-syncs on every linked save (recovers from Moonraker state loss).
- **Crash-report modal occluded by install wizard** ([#849]) — backdrop now parents to the top layer so Send/Dismiss is always reachable.
- **i18n: icon_font_hero missing on smaller font tiers** — previously mapped to xxlarge-only glyphs, producing font-not-linked warnings and empty icons on CC1, AD5M, pi32, and K2. Now maps to each tier's largest available glyph.
- **Wizard Back/Next crash during install** ([#848], [#843]) — wizard navigation routes through lv_async_call so the clean+rebuild runs outside the input-release tick.
- **AMS AFC: redundant per-update hashtable lookup** — caller loops already know the slot index; closes the torn-pointer fault seen in bundle 8SA9DQZ4.

### Changed
- **i18n memory: −4.7 MB peak RSS on CC1** — dropped dead lv_i18n path; translations load per-locale on demand. Saves ~1.2 MB binary / ~521 KB VmExe; VmHWM drops 19 MB → 14 MB on CC1 (under the 15 MB OOM warning threshold). All 9 languages remain runtime-selectable.

## [0.99.40] - 2026-04-21

### Added
- **XML hot-reload** — set `HELIX_HOT_RELOAD=1` to watch `ui_xml/` (including breakpoint subdirs) and rebuild the active panel, overlay, or modal in place when a file saves. Panels, overlays, modals, and the navigation stack all implement a `rebuild()` hook; after-reload callbacks re-show the top modal and refresh observer bindings. The watcher warns when a reload would dangle an XML subject pointer so you see it immediately instead of as a later crash.
- **Print Select:** 3-column card grid on 480px breakpoints (previously 2-column) — more prints visible without scrolling on wider portraits.

### Fixed
- **Android update check** — libhv is built without SSL on Android, so HTTPS to R2 and GitHub silently failed with "Connection failed (R2 + GitHub)". Update-check traffic now routes through Android's system TLS stack via a JNI bridge to `HttpURLConnection`. The nightly auto-check and its in-app "New Version Available" notification now work, and the Install button opens the Play Store listing instead of attempting a tarball install.
- Action-prompt modal: remove button event callbacks before freeing `user_data` to avoid a use-after-free on dismissal ([#840]).
- LVGL: guard against a garbage non-null font pointer in the `sw_label` renderer that crashed under rare layout cascades ([#842]).
- AMS edit modal: async-delete spool list children to avoid the LVGL event-list corruption pattern (L081) ([#845]).
- Wizard: stop the connection spinner animation before `lv_obj_clean` to prevent a use-after-free on step transitions ([#843]).
- AMS AD5X IFS: close the race where `_IFS_VARS` was enabled before the macro had been verified present on the printer.
- Discovery (AD5X): IFS runout sensors now appear in `filament_sensor_names` so the runout row shows on AD5X.
- Runout modal: removed stray XML `event_cb` declarations that produced "callback not found" warnings in the log.
- Hot-reload: reset `error_code` between filesystem queries and use the non-throwing iterator increment — stops the watcher from aborting on transient `ENOENT`.
- About settings: Check-for-Updates row description is visible at every breakpoint, so the "Error" / version text doesn't get hidden on narrow layouts.
- Update flow: skip the redundant confirmation modal when the user already confirmed "Install" on the in-app update notification.

### Changed
- AD5M / AD5X launcher: enable `MALLOC_CHECK_=3` and `MALLOC_PERTURB_` for heap diagnostics on the printers most prone to memory-pressure crashes ([#838]).

## [0.99.39] - 2026-04-20

### Added
- **Synth PCM backends on VoiceSlot** — ALSA and SDL backends now render per-sample through `VoiceSlot` with per-sample envelope and filter state. The sequencer publishes `NoteEvent` for continuous-audio backends and per-tick events for PWM/buzzer backends, unifying envelope behavior across every platform.
- **Sound preview overlay** — Browse and preview individual sounds from the sound settings; a new "Preview Sounds" button opens `SoundPreviewOverlay`, a dynamic button grid populated from `SoundManager::get_sound_names()`.
- **Build:** New `PLATFORM_TARGET=ad5m-br` mode and `make install DESTDIR=...`
  target, enabling external build systems (starting with the AD5M Klipper Mod
  firmware) to package HelixScreen as a native variant. See
  `docs/devel/AD5M_KMOD_VARIANT.md`. The existing `ad5m` target is unchanged.
- Per-printer first-print phase defaults — each preset ships its own pre-print warm-up timing.
- Header bar: per-widget `icon_size` override for oversized action-button glyphs.
- Crash diagnostics: breadcrumb on the `discovery-complete` path to narrow the recurring copy-assign crash signature.

### Fixed
- **Installer (K1 / K2 / Snapmaker U1):** Repaired five regressions from the
  earlier `config/` → `assets/config/` refactor. On affected boards the
  installer was silently leaving the stock Creality UI running alongside
  HelixScreen (`[WARN] No platform hooks for: k2`) and skipping Mainsail/Fluidd
  config symlinks (`[INFO] No printer_data/config found, skipping config
  symlink`). The underlying issues: init script sourced hooks from a path
  that no longer existed; `deploy_platform_hooks` looked under
  `config/platform/` instead of `assets/config/platform/`; `KLIPPER_HOME`
  defaulted to `/root` on K1 and K2 whose `printer_data` lives on `/usr/data`
  and `/mnt/UDISK` respectively; Snapmaker U1's detection of `/home/lava` was
  fragile on freshly-flashed units. All five fixes auto-apply on the next
  self-update. Already-installed users who cannot update can apply the
  migration manually:
  ```sh
  /etc/init.d/app stop; /etc/init.d/app disable   # K2 only
  mkdir -p /opt/helixscreen/platform
  cp /opt/helixscreen/assets/config/platform/hooks-k2.sh \
     /opt/helixscreen/platform/hooks.sh
  chmod +x /opt/helixscreen/platform/hooks.sh
  sed -i 's|/assets/config/platform/hooks\.sh|/platform/hooks.sh|' \
     /etc/init.d/S99helixscreen
  /etc/init.d/S99helixscreen restart
  ```
  Verified on K1C, K2 Plus, AD5M Forge-X, Snapmaker U1, and CC1 hardware.
- Discovery: `box` and `enclosure` now match as chamber-sensor keywords — Elegoo COSMOS `temperature_sensor box` and common modder `enclosure` names enable the chamber row on CC1 and similar builds.
- Presets: Snapmaker U1 macros and hotend fan aligned with hardware; CC1 hardware list completed and filament sensor pre-declared; K1C `fan2` role and filament macros aligned with stock firmware; K2 Plus hardware list corrected (bogus "K2 Max" entry removed).
- Display: bundle minimal zoneinfo so IANA timezones resolve on CC1 (ships without `/usr/share/zoneinfo`).
- Synth: step-boundary silence no longer kills active PCM notes; `button_tap` suppressed in the preview overlay; per-sample envelope restores attack/release shape; filter state preserved across buffer boundaries; smaller SDL ring buffer cuts perceived latency.
- Print status: low-memory deactivation clears gcode-viewer dedup guards; `end_overlay` observer reset before subject deinit; MICRO metadata sizing and end-overlay race.
- Print: `ActivePrintMediaManager` uses an immediate observer to close the stale-thumbnail race during rapid print transitions.
- Print select: egg placeholder removed; history/queue fetch guards hardened so transient Moonraker outages don't leave the panel empty.
- Toast: responsive width restored after the stacking refactor.

### Changed
- Synth architecture: `set_voice_envelope` removed (deprecated); PCM backends now own per-sample rendering through `VoiceSlot`.
- Build: libhv's symlinked `LIBHV_DIR` cleaned of stale artifacts; `ad5m-br` added to sound + `.PHONY` filters; cmake scaffolding pruned from the installed `ui_xml/` tree.

## [0.99.38] - 2026-04-20

### Added
- Toast notifications now stack when multiple fire simultaneously; startup warnings (NOTIFY_*) queue through PendingStartupWarnings so none are lost during init.
- QIDI Box AMS backend scaffolding — placeholder for future PLUS4/Q2/MAX4 filament system support.
- Per-extruder filament consumption routing: multi-extruder printers track spool usage independently per tool.
- Tool-changer identity mapping: `slot_for_extruder()` routes the correct AMS slot to each physical tool.
- Printer discovery treats 'cavity' as a chamber synonym (Snapmaker U1 compatibility).

### Fixed
- Wizard: connection step migrated to AsyncLifetimeGuard, preventing use-after-free on rapid step transitions; WiFi subject re-init is now guarded.
- Wizard: manual printer-type pick now correctly applies the selected preset (#837).
- Presets: ForgeX split from KlipperMod profile; ZMOD stepper fan name corrected.
- AD5M ZMOD: probe for `/dev/fb0` before launching to avoid cold-boot race condition.
- Android: read-only seed bundle now ships via build-time packaging manifest.
- Presets: AD5M fan defaults aligned with actual hardware (#837).
- Print start: deduplicate probe samples and complete detection on first extrusion move.
- Home panel: widget ID cache reads from populate snapshot, not post-populate re-read.
- Home panel: favorite macro label no longer overlays icon; long names truncate with ellipsis.
- Home panel: Home label placed on same row as homing buttons.
- AMS panel: blank weight field shown for unknown spool instead of "-1".
- Per-extruder filament subjects pre-populated to prevent null-subject observer crashes.

### Changed
- Print status panel refactored from imperative UI state to declarative XML bindings.

## [0.99.37] - 2026-04-19

### Added
- Filament slot metadata now persists across restarts and reconnects on AD5X IFS, Snapmaker U1, ACE, and CFS — brand, spool name, Spoolman link, and weights survive Klipper reloads and printer reboots.
- OrcaSlicer 2.3.2+ automatic filament sync: HelixScreen writes the AFC-originated `lane_data` Moonraker DB convention, so Orca's filament panel picks up your slot metadata with zero configuration.
- "Clear Spool" entry in the AMS slot context menu — clears user overrides and falls the slot back to firmware-reported state. `Spool Info` and `Clear Spool` are now separate menu actions.
- Empty-but-overridden slots now ghost-render (20% opacity) across all backends, matching the previous AFC-only behavior.
- Automatic override clearing on detected physical spool swap: color change for IFS, RFID UID change for Snapmaker, material+color fingerprint change for CFS, status transition (empty→loaded) for ACE.
- Per-backend material whitelist and alias normalization for AMS (e.g., `PLA-BASIC` → `PLA`).
- Public specification at `docs/specs/filament_slots.md` for the shared `lane_data` convention.
- Crash diagnostics: breadcrumbs for wizard step transitions, language changes, and the previous queue-callback tag.
- ARM32 frame-pointer unwinding fallback so Pi32 and SonicPad crashes produce usable backtraces when `backtrace()` fails.
- Translation strings for camera, QR code, and print stats labels.

### Fixed
- Snapmaker U1: `set_slot_info` honors the `persist` parameter — user edits were previously discarded on the next Klipper status poll.
- Snapmaker U1: RFID `SUB_TYPE` is now mapped to the spool name and shown in the edit modal.
- Wizard: freeze `UpdateQueue` around step transitions to prevent async-callback races on quick advance (#827).
- Crash handler: reorder so `backtrace()` runs last, with FP-walk fallback (#827).
- Crash reporter: filter post-crash lines out of the log tail (#827).
- Crash: `std::terminate` exit encodes `128 + SIGABRT` so the watchdog surfaces the recovery dialog.
- Brother QL label print: route network send through HttpExecutor — Test Print no longer crashes from unbounded thread spawns.
- Spoolman: `Connect` probe runs on HttpExecutor and the button is disabled in-flight.
- Home/widget/tool/temp rebuilds use `safe_clean_children` to escape the UpdateQueue batch (#834, #776).
- AMS pre-print filament runout warning suppressed for auto-unload backends (IFS).
- AMS edit modal: skip Spoolman save when Spoolman is unavailable so local overrides still persist.
- AMS panel: `remaining_weight_g=-1` displays as "unknown" rather than empty; bypass label escapes the canvas; MICRO/TINY layouts no longer clip spool cards or temp graph.
- Moonraker API: `database.get_item` / `database.get_namespace` now unwrap the `response["result"]` envelope.
- AD5X IFS: defer initial `GET_ZCOLOR` until Klippy reports ready.
- AD5X IFS: latch the `_IFS_VARS` macro-missing check so `save_variables` notifications can't re-enable the broken path.
- Color picker: selected-preset outline, segmented tab fill, MICRO/TINY polish.
- Dropdown: honor theme `border_radius` as local style; narrow backup dropdown at MICRO/TINY.
- Filament panel: temperature graph fills and spool card sizes to content so the whole card stays on-screen at MICRO/TINY.
- Network widget: re-detect Wi-Fi when backend reports READY so "Disconnected" unsticks after async init (#819).
- IFS: pre-update baseline color in `set_slot_info` to avoid self-wiping the override it just set.
- Moonraker: tighten `delete_item` missing-key detection (prefer HTTP 404).

### Changed
- ACE: user override fields merge with firmware-reported data field-by-field (empty override fields fall through to firmware). Previously the override replaced the entire slot record.
- Pre-existing `helix-screen:ace_slot_overrides` / `helix-screen:cfs_slot_overrides` DB entries auto-migrate to `lane_data` on first launch; legacy JSON caches are removed after migration.

## [0.99.36] - 2026-04-18

### Added
- Live spool weight tracking without Spoolman: HelixScreen now decrements the locally-stored external spool's weight during a print, persists it on pause/end, re-snapshots when you edit the weight externally, and warns before queuing a print that needs more filament than the spool has left.
- Per-preset default home layouts — fresh installs get curated layouts per printer preset instead of one generic grid.
- Default home anchors nozzle + bed temperature widgets stacked next to print status across every breakpoint.
- Default home swaps the single-slot filament widget for the AMS widget when an AMS is present.
- Unified crash log collection: reports pull log tails from file, syslog, or journalctl automatically (AD5M/AD5X via syslog, Pi via journald) and auto-attach a debug bundle to the report for triage.

### Fixed
- GridEditMode: clear cached widget pointers after async rebuild to prevent SIGSEGV when deferred selection-chrome destroy runs on freed objects.
- Screensaver and confetti teardown routed through safe deferred delete so parent cleanup no longer races with pending async widget deletion.
- LVGL: disable blur tree walk unconditionally (#820).
- LVGL: cap `lv_obj_get_screen` parent walk to survive cyclic parent trees.
- Wi-Fi: NetworkWidget wakes when the backend reports READY after async init (#819).
- AD5X: backlight-off sleep restored for pre-#431 units via config v13 migration.
- FlashForge AD5M: Screws Tilt directions corrected (no longer inverted).
- Bed mesh: calibrate modal sizes to its content.
- CC1: bed mesh calibration sequence and progress count for load_cell_probe.
- AD5X IFS: use `GET_ZCOLOR SILENT=1` for live loaded-slot state.
- Edit mode: widget chrome buttons responsive across breakpoints.
- Default home: carousel deferred until after the first-run wizard dismisses.
- Console: gcode console font bumped to 10px on the micro breakpoint.
- AMS state: `get_external_spool_info` now mutex-locks the in-memory cache.

### Changed
- Theme: Soft corner radius bumped to 3px on the micro breakpoint (was 2px) — less sharp on 480x272 screens.
- Crash report worker renders breadcrumbs, heap snapshot, LVGL event log, and debug-bundle link in filed issues (#826).

## [0.99.35] - 2026-04-17

### Added
- Touch-friendly filament mapping: print-file details card shows a 2×2 grid of pills with the tool number (Tx) centered inside the gcode color dot; overflow past six tools collapses into a "+N" indicator. Mapping modal rows and slot-picker popup rows are taller, wider, and consistent with the same Tx-in-dot treatment.

### Fixed
- Settings → About: update modal reshows correctly after backdrop/ESC dismiss; DownloadStatus is reset before reopening.
- Updater: detect a wedged `/var/log` before launching install.sh; set `O_CLOEXEC` on the instance lock so post-install restart is not blocked.
- Restart: exec in-place instead of fork+exec to avoid a zombie race.
- Barcode scanner: AZERTY punctuation mapping corrected with a cross-layout regression test; BT pairing UX, keycode diagnostics, accent variant, reduced log noise.
- Bluetooth: register BlueZ `Agent1` so pairing completes into a real bond.
- Temperature graph: chamber series now shown for sensor-only (no thermistor) setups.
- Wi-Fi: require a live NetworkManager daemon before choosing the NM backend.
- Crash reports (AD5X / MIPS): surface the return-address register so MIPS backtraces resolve (prestonbrown/helixscreen#818).

## [0.99.34] - 2026-04-16

Hotfix for the v0.99.33 release: cross-compiled release bundles for every embedded platform (ad5m, ad5x, cc1, k1, k2, pi, pi32, snapmaker-u1, x86) shipped without `assets/config/`, causing "Could not load printer database" on first launch and breaking shipped themes, platform init hooks, print start profiles, and sound themes. v0.99.33 artifacts have been withdrawn.

### Fixed
- Release bundle omitted `assets/config/` seed tree — the refactor that split RO seeds out of `config/` updated `scripts/package.sh` but missed `mk/cross.mk`, which is the actual pipeline every embedded release uses. All `release-*` targets now ship `assets/config/printer_database.json`, `printing_tips.json`, `default_layout.json`, `helix_macros.cfg`, `themes/defaults/`, `presets/`, `print_start_profiles/`, `sounds/`, and `platform/hooks-*.sh`.

## [0.99.33] - 2026-04-16

- LVGL display anomaly section in stability dashboard
- Bluetooth HID scanner binding by MAC address with exclusive grab
- BT HID link verification after pairing with bond-refusal warning
- Bluetooth `enumerate_known` API for paired device listing
- `HELIX_CONFIG_DIR` and `HELIX_DATA_DIR` env vars for Yocto/read-only rootfs deployments

- Bluetooth: `thread_id_` race, submit TOCTOU, slot unref routing, `StartNotify` fallback guard
- Network: async backend init eliminates UI-thread blocking; self-join deadlock and ethernet thread pool fixes
- Exclude object: sync removals from Klipper status, drop stuck optimistic visuals on print end, silence spurious pre-print RPC timeouts
- Moonraker API callbacks guarded with lifetime tokens to prevent use-after-free
- Controls: segmented homing button bar on controls and micro controls panels
- Slider: responsive knob padding at tiny/micro breakpoints; fix overflow_visible attribute name
- Z-offset: compact format and wider temp icon gap at tiny breakpoint
- Camera: sleep callback token survives stream stop/start cycles
- Watchdog: bail out of restart loop on persistent failure instead of infinite retries
- Tour: re-target highlight on breakpoint change; cancel on navigation away from Home
- AMS: unlink external spool updates UI when previous filament color was black
- Scanner: dismiss progress toast on pair failure; wrap BT thread spawns in try/catch
- Label renderer: render negative spool IDs as 'TEST'
- Tool state: atomic write for `tool_spools.json` prevents corruption on crash
- API/camera: catch EAGAIN on `join_helper` thread spawn in destructors
- Print status idle card: micro breakpoint polish, subject-driven visibility
- Installer: prefer `/user-resource` for temp dir on CC1
- Help icon: resolve via responsive theme token
- Updater: 2min timeout extended for slow printers

### Changed
- Config layout: read-only seed configs moved to `assets/config/`, writable state stays in `config/`
- Bluetooth: D-Bus operations serialized through dedicated BusThread instead of ad-hoc thread spawns
- Power-device API calls migrated to HttpExecutor with tok.defer lifecycle safety
