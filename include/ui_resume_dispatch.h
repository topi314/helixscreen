/// failure) emit a contextual `NOTIFY_ERROR` toast and invoke `on_failure`,
/// which call sites typically use to clear optimistic-UI state.
///
/// All work is async; this returns immediately. `on_failure` and the
/// internal toast emission fire on the **main thread** even when the
/// underlying macro error callback originates from a background WebSocket
/// thread — the helper bounces those through the UpdateQueue. Callers
/// don't need to do their own marshalling for the on_failure body, but
/// they must still ensure any state it touches is alive at the time of
/// the bounce (singletons or main-thread-owned state are the usual
/// choices).

/// @param api          Moonraker API to use for macro execution. Must
///                     outlive the dispatch — typically a panel member or
///                     a singleton-owned pointer. Must not be nullptr;
///                     callers handle the api == nullptr case (e.g. mock
///                     mode fallback) before calling.
/// @param log_prefix   Spdlog tag for log lines, e.g. `"[Print Status]"`.
///                     Passed by value so the helper owns its own copy
///                     and the async lambdas don't depend on the caller's
///                     storage outliving the dispatch.
/// @param on_failure   Optional. Invoked on the main thread on either
///                     error path AFTER the toast has been emitted.
///                     Default: no-op.
