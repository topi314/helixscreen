 * @file telemetry_manager.h
 * @brief Anonymous, opt-in telemetry for HelixScreen
 *
 * Collects aggregate usage data (session starts, print outcomes) to help
 * improve HelixScreen. All telemetry is:
 *
 * - **Opt-in**: Disabled by default, user must explicitly enable via settings UI.
 * - **Anonymous**: Device identity is a double-hashed UUID (SHA-256 of UUID + random salt).
 *   The raw UUID never leaves the device.
 * - **Minimal**: Only session and print outcome events are collected. No filenames,
 *   no G-code content, no network identifiers, no personal information.
 * - **Transparent**: Queue contents are inspectable via get_queue_snapshot().
 * - **GDPR-friendly**: Users can disable at any time; clear_queue() purges all
 *   pending events. No data is transmitted until the user opts in.
 *
 * Architecture:
 * @code
 * TelemetryManager (singleton)
 * +-- Event Queue (mutex-protected, persisted to disk)
 * |   +-- Session events (app launch)
 * |   +-- Print outcome events (success/failure/cancel)
 * +-- Device Identity (UUID v4 + salt, stored in config dir)
 * +-- LVGL Subject (reactive binding for settings toggle)
 * +-- Transmission (Phase 3: batched HTTPS POST to endpoint)
 * @endcode
 *
 * Thread safety:
 * - Event recording (record_session, record_print_outcome) is thread-safe
 *   and may be called from any thread.
 * - LVGL subject access (enabled_subject) must happen on the main LVGL thread.
 * - Transmission (try_send) runs on a background thread.
 *
 * Usage:
 * @code
 * auto& telemetry = TelemetryManager::instance();
 * telemetry.init("config");  // Load persisted state
 *
 * // User enables telemetry in settings UI (binds to enabled_subject())
 * telemetry.set_enabled(true);
 *
 * // Record events throughout the application lifetime
 * telemetry.record_session();
 * telemetry.record_print_outcome("success", 3600, 10, 1500.0f, "PLA", 210, 60);
 *
 * // On shutdown
 * telemetry.shutdown();
 * @endcode
 *
 * @see UpdateChecker for similar singleton + background thread + LVGL subject pattern
 * @see SettingsManager for similar singleton + LVGL subject + persistence pattern
