 *
 * Installs signal handlers for SIGSEGV, SIGABRT, SIGBUS, SIGFPE.
 * On crash, writes a minimal crash file to disk using only
 * async-signal-safe functions (open, write, close, _exit).
 * NO heap allocation, NO mutex, NO spdlog in the signal handler.
 *
 * On next startup, TelemetryManager reads the crash file and
 * enqueues it as a telemetry event.
