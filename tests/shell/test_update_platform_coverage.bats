# Silent brick history:
#   v0.99.41: HELIX_PLATFORM_SNAPMAKER_U1 missing from get_platform_key() →
#             U1 devices downloaded helixscreen-pi-*.tar.gz on self-update,
#             ended up with a binary that NEEDED libsystemd/libinput/libEGL/
#             libGLESv2/libgbm — none present on U1 → exec failure.
#   Earlier:  HELIX_PLATFORM_X86 missing from the same function (fixed by
#             640b2a6ab).
#
# These tests enforce that:
#   1. Every -DHELIX_PLATFORM_* define in mk/cross.mk has a matching branch
#      in src/system/update_checker.cpp::get_platform_key().
#   2. Every PLATFORM_TARGET in the release.yml matrix has a corresponding
#      entry in the known_platforms allowlist in test_update_checker.cpp
#      (so a missing branch fails unit tests instead of silently shipping).
#   3. Every platform key returned by get_platform_key() is also in the
#      known_platforms allowlist (catches typos in the return string).

# AND mk/cross.mk's baked release_info.json, so the two can't drift. Moonraker
# downloads the asset whose name == release_info.json's asset_name; if no asset
# matches, it falls back to the alphabetically-first release asset — a .sym
# debug file — and dies with "File is not a zip file"
# (prestonbrown/helixscreen#993). These run the real function and check it
# resolves every platform to an asset the release matrix actually builds.
