# Settings: Touch & Input

Reached from **Settings → System → Touch & Input**. Groups every setting that affects how the screen reads finger input — calibration, debug visualization, jitter filtering, and scroll feel.

## Touch Calibration

Recalibrate if taps register in the wrong location:

1. Tap **Touch Calibration**
2. Tap each crosshair target as it appears on screen (3 points, 7 taps each)
3. Test that taps land correctly in the verify area
4. Tap **Accept** to save (or **Retry** to redo)

The row description shows "Calibrated" or "Not calibrated" status. Always available — you can recalibrate even on screens that auto-detect as already correct. For the full menu of force-calibration options (env var, config file, CLI) and per-platform paths, see the [Touch Calibration Guide](../touch-calibration.md).

## Show Touch Points

Toggles a debug overlay that draws a ripple at every touch point. Useful when taps feel offset or buttons aren't responding where you expect — turn it on, tap around, and see exactly where the system thinks your finger is. Turn off when done.

Takes effect immediately — no restart required.

> Persistent equivalent: `HELIX_DEBUG_TOUCH=1` in `helixscreen.env`. The Settings toggle and the env var read the same flag.

## Touch Jitter Filter

A dead zone in pixels that suppresses tiny coordinate noise from the touch controller. Default `5` works for most panels.

| Symptom | Suggested value |
|---|---|
| Stationary taps register as swipes (common on Goodix GT9xx capacitive controllers) | **15–25** |
| Default — works on most panels | **5** |
| Disable the filter entirely (ultra-precise touch) | **0** |

Requires a restart to take effect. HelixScreen offers a restart prompt automatically after you change the slider.

## Scroll Engage Distance

Pixels of finger travel before a press becomes a scroll instead of a click. Default `10`.

| Symptom | Suggested value |
|---|---|
| Scrolls fire a click on whatever was under your finger when you meant to scroll | **5** |
| Default — sweet spot for most panels | **10** |
| Taps feel twitchy, micro-wobbles start scrolls | **15** |

Requires a restart to take effect.

## Scroll Guard

Some capacitive controllers fire a phantom "clicked" event when you lift your finger after scrolling. Enable Scroll Guard to ignore taps for ~80 ms after a scroll ends.

FlashForge AD5M and AD5X enable this automatically via their hardware presets — leave it on. Most Raspberry Pi setups don't need it.

Requires a restart to take effect.

> Still seeing phantom clicks with the guard enabled? Some controllers need a longer cooldown. Tune `scroll_guard_cooldown_ms` in `settings.json` — see the [TROUBLESHOOTING guide § Accidental Button Presses After Scrolling](../../TROUBLESHOOTING.md#accidental-button-presses-after-scrolling).
