## Quick Debugging Guide

**Before troubleshooting anything, increase log verbosity. Three taps, no SSH:**

1. **Settings → System → Log Level → Debug** (or Trace for the deepest detail)
2. Reproduce the problem
3. **Settings → Help & About → Upload Debug Bundle** — collects the verbose log + system info and gives you a short share code to paste into a bug report
4. Set Log Level back to **Warn** when done — Debug and Trace add CPU and log volume

That's the path for almost everyone. Use the alternatives below only if you can't reach Settings.

**If the UI is broken or you need persistent verbose logging across reboots** — set the level in `helixscreen.env` (the launcher reads this on every start):

```
HELIX_LOG_LEVEL=debug    # trace, debug, info, warn, error, critical, off
```

The file lives at `<install dir>/config/helixscreen.env` (or `/etc/helixscreen/helixscreen.env`). Restart the service after editing:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart helixscreen        # Raspberry Pi
/etc/init.d/S99helixscreen restart        # K1 / K2 / Snapmaker U1
/etc/init.d/S80helixscreen restart        # AD5M
/etc/init.d/helixscreen restart           # CC1
```

Then tail the log:

```bash
sudo journalctl -u helixscreen -f         # Raspberry Pi (systemd)
tail -f /var/log/messages | grep helix    # AD5M / non-systemd
```

**Verbosity levels:**
- `warn` — production default (errors and warnings only)
- `info` — connection events, panel changes
- `debug` — detailed state changes, API calls
- `trace` — everything including LVGL internals

> **Remember to set it back to `warn`** when done — verbose logging impacts performance and log volume.

**Last-resort CLI:** if the service won't start at all, run the binary directly to see startup output: `~/helixscreen/bin/helix-screen -vv` (stop the service first so it doesn't fight for the framebuffer).

---

## Startup Issues

### HelixScreen crashes immediately (segfault)

**Symptoms:**
- Service starts then immediately exits
- "Segmentation fault" in logs
- Black screen, no UI appears

**Common causes:**

1. **Missing or corrupt assets** (use your actual install path)
   ```bash
   # Check assets exist (Pi: ~/helixscreen or /opt/helixscreen)
   ls -la ~/helixscreen/assets/
   ls -la ~/helixscreen/assets/fonts/
   ls -la ~/helixscreen/xml/
   ```

2. **Wrong display backend for your hardware**
   ```bash
   # Check what display devices exist
   ls -la /dev/fb*      # Framebuffer devices
   ls -la /dev/dri/*    # DRM devices

   # Pi 4 typically uses /dev/dri/card1
   # Pi 5 may use /dev/dri/card1 or card2
   # Flashforge Adventurer 5M (AD5M) uses framebuffer /dev/fb0
   ```

3. **Permission issues**
   ```bash
   # Check user is in required groups
   groups
   # Should include: video, input, render
   ```

### "No display device found"

**Symptoms:**
- Log shows "No suitable DRM device found" or similar
- Service keeps restarting

**Solutions:**

**Specify the DRM device explicitly:**
```json
// ~/helixscreen/config/settings.json (or /opt/helixscreen/config/)
{
  "display": {
    "drm_device": "/dev/dri/card1"
  }
}
```

**For Pi 5, try different cards:**
- `card0` = v3d (3D acceleration only, won't work)
- `card1` = DSI touchscreen
- `card2` = HDMI via vc4

### Logs are empty or not appearing

**Symptoms:**
- `journalctl -u helixscreen` shows nothing useful
- Log file doesn't exist

**Causes:**
1. Log destination misconfigured
2. Service not actually running
3. Crash before logging initializes

**Solutions:**

**Check service status first:**
```bash
sudo systemctl status helixscreen
```

**Force console logging for debugging:**
```bash
# Run manually to see all output (use your actual install path)
sudo ~/helixscreen/bin/helix-screen -vvv
```

**Check log destination in config:**
```json
{
  "log_dest": "auto",
  "log_level": "info"
}
```
Valid `log_dest` values: `auto`, `journal`, `syslog`, `file`, `console`

## Connection Issues

### "Cannot connect to Moonraker"

**Symptoms:**
- Red connection indicator on home screen
- "Disconnected" status
- Cannot control printer

**Causes:**
1. Wrong IP address or port
2. Moonraker not running
3. Firewall blocking connection
4. Network issues

**Solutions:**

**Check Moonraker is running:**
```bash
sudo systemctl status moonraker
```
If stopped: `sudo systemctl start moonraker`

**Verify the IP address:**
```bash
# On the Pi running Klipper
hostname -I
```
Update config with correct IP.

**Test connection manually:**
```bash
curl http://localhost:7125/printer/info
```
Should return JSON with printer info.

**Check firewall:**
```bash
sudo ufw status
# If active, allow Moonraker:
sudo ufw allow 7125/tcp
```

---

### "Connection lost" during print

**Symptoms:**
- Disconnect toast appears
- UI shows "Disconnected"
- Print continues (Klipper handles it)

**Causes:**
1. Network instability (WiFi)
2. Moonraker timeout
3. Power management issues

**Solutions:**

**Use Ethernet if possible** - wired connections are more reliable.

**Check WiFi signal strength:**
```bash
iwconfig wlan0 | grep -i signal
```

**Disable WiFi power management:**
```bash
sudo iw wlan0 set power_save off
```

To make permanent, add to `/etc/rc.local`:
```bash
iw wlan0 set power_save off
```

**Increase Moonraker timeouts:**
```json
{
  "printer": {
    "moonraker_connection_timeout_ms": 15000,
    "moonraker_request_timeout_ms": 60000
  }
}
```
Note: Values are in milliseconds (15000ms = 15 seconds).

---

### WiFi won't connect

**Symptoms:**
- WiFi setup in wizard fails
- Network not found
- Authentication failures

**Solutions:**

**Verify WiFi is working at OS level:**
```bash
nmcli device wifi list
```

**Check NetworkManager is running:**
```bash
sudo systemctl status NetworkManager
```

**Manual WiFi connection:**
```bash
sudo nmcli device wifi connect "YourSSID" password "YourPassword"
```

**For hidden networks:**
```bash
sudo nmcli device wifi connect "HiddenSSID" password "Password" hidden yes
```

> **Note:** Older guides may reference `wpa_supplicant` directly, but MainsailOS and most modern systems use NetworkManager. Use `nmcli` commands instead.

### WiFi permission denied

**Symptoms:**
- WiFi scan shows no networks (but WiFi works from command line)
- "Permission denied" error when connecting
- WiFi worked before an update but stopped working

**Cause:**
HelixScreen needs permission (via polkit rules) to manage WiFi through NetworkManager. These rules are installed automatically, but can be missing if:
- HelixScreen was installed before NetworkManager was set up
- A self-update couldn't install permission rules (runs with restricted privileges)
- The polkit rules file was deleted or corrupted

**Solutions:**

**Re-run the installer** (recommended — installs correct polkit rules):
```bash
curl -fsSL https://releases.helixscreen.org/install.sh | bash
```

**Verify polkit rules are installed:**
```bash
# Check for HelixScreen polkit rules (one of these should exist)
ls -la /etc/polkit-1/rules.d/50-helixscreen-network.rules
ls -la /etc/polkit-1/localauthority/50-local.d/helixscreen-network.pkla
```

**Check NetworkManager permissions:**
```bash
nmcli general permissions
```
If most entries show "no" instead of "yes", polkit rules are missing.

**Manual fix** (if re-running installer isn't possible):

Create `/etc/NetworkManager/conf.d/any-user.conf`:
```ini
[main]
auth-polkit=false
```
Then restart NetworkManager:
```bash
sudo systemctl restart NetworkManager
sudo systemctl restart helixscreen
```

> **Note:** The manual fix disables permission checks for all users. The installer method is preferred as it only grants access to the HelixScreen service user.

---

### SSL/TLS certificate errors

**Symptoms:**
- Connection fails with certificate errors
- Works with HTTP but not HTTPS

**Cause:**
System time is wrong, making SSL certificates appear invalid.

**Solution:**
```bash
# Check current time
date

# Sync time manually
sudo timedatectl set-ntp true

# Or force sync
sudo systemctl restart systemd-timesyncd
```

---

## Display Issues

### Black screen on startup

**Symptoms:**
- Display stays black
- Service shows running but no output

**Causes:**
1. Wrong display driver
2. Permission issues
3. Display not detected

**Solutions:**

**Check service is running:**
```bash
sudo systemctl status helixscreen
sudo journalctl -u helixscreen -n 50
```

**Identify your display hardware:**
```bash
# Framebuffer devices (older displays, Flashforge AD5M)
ls -la /dev/fb*

# DRM devices (Pi 4/5, modern displays)
ls -la /dev/dri/*
```

**Check display permissions:**
```bash
# User needs video group access
groups
# Should include 'video'
sudo usermod -aG video $USER
# Log out and back in for group change to take effect
```

**For DRM displays, specify device:**
```json
{
  "display": {
    "drm_device": "/dev/dri/card1"
  }
}
```

---

### Wrong screen size or resolution

**Symptoms:**
- UI too small or too large
- Partial screen visible
- Stretched or squished display

**Solutions:**

HelixScreen auto-detects resolution from DRM and framebuffer backends. If auto-detection picks the wrong resolution, override it with the `-s` flag:

```bash
# In helixscreen.service ExecStart, add -s with a named size or WxH:
ExecStart=/opt/helixscreen/bin/helix-launcher.sh -s large
# or: -s 1024x600
# Named sizes: micro, tiny, small, medium, large, xlarge
```

Then reload:
```bash
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl restart helixscreen
```

---

### Resolution stuck at the wrong size, or `-s` has no effect

**Symptoms:**
- HelixScreen shows a "Cannot set HelixScreen to selected resolution" message on startup
- Display is locked at 800x480 (or similar) even though you passed `-s large` or `-s 1024x600`
- System journal contains `[DRM Backend]` or `[fbdev Backend]` warnings about the requested size

**Cause:** HelixScreen can only use resolutions the kernel exposes to it. If the kernel display driver is misconfigured, or if a fallback driver like `simpledrm` is active, the display is locked to whatever the bootloader programmed at power-on — HelixScreen cannot override this at runtime.

**Fix on Raspberry Pi / RatOS:**

1. Open the boot config:
   ```bash
   sudo nano /boot/firmware/config.txt
   ```

2. Make sure this line is present and not commented out:
   ```
   dtoverlay=vc4-kms-v3d
   ```

3. If you are using a specific HDMI mode (e.g., 1024x600), add the appropriate `hdmi_cvt` / `hdmi_group` / `hdmi_mode` lines per the Raspberry Pi HDMI documentation.

4. Reboot.

5. After reboot, verify the real DRM driver is now active:
   ```bash
   ls /sys/class/drm/
   ```
   You should see something like `card0-HDMI-A-1`. If you still see only `card0` and `dmesg | grep -i drm` mentions `simpledrm`, the vc4 overlay did not load — double-check `/boot/firmware/config.txt` for typos and any conflicting `dtoverlay` lines.

**Check what modes the kernel knows about:**
```bash
cat /sys/class/drm/card0-HDMI-A-1/modes
```
This lists the resolutions the DRM driver will accept for the `-s` flag.

### Display upside down or rotated

**Symptoms:**
- Content displayed at wrong angle
- Touch offset from visual

**Automatic detection:**

HelixScreen automatically detects display orientation on first boot using the kernel's panel orientation setting. If your display is physically mounted upside down and the kernel knows about it (via `panel_orientation=upside_down` in the kernel command line), HelixScreen detects this and applies the correct rotation automatically — both the splash screen and the main UI will appear right-side up.

On framebuffer displays only (e.g., AD5M, Allwinner-based devices — **not** Raspberry Pi), an interactive rotation wizard runs on first boot: it cycles through 0°, 90°, 180°, and 270° — tap the screen when the text appears right-side up, then tap again to confirm. This wizard is not available on Raspberry Pi or other DRM-based displays — use the kernel `panel_orientation` parameter or manual config instead.

The detected rotation is saved to the config file and applied on all subsequent boots.

**Setting panel orientation in the kernel (Raspberry Pi):**

Edit `/boot/firmware/cmdline.txt` and add a `video=` parameter for your display connector:

```
video=DSI-1:panel_orientation=upside_down
```

Valid orientations: `normal`, `upside_down`, `left_side_up`, `right_side_up`. HelixScreen reads this on startup and applies the corresponding rotation.

**Manual rotation:**

Edit your config file (typically `~/helixscreen/config/settings.json` or `/opt/helixscreen/config/settings.json`):

```json
{
  "display": {
    "rotate": 180
  }
}
```

Valid values: `0`, `90`, `180`, `270`. Restart HelixScreen after changing this value. Touch coordinates are automatically adjusted to match — no separate touch configuration is needed.

**How rotation works under the hood:**

When you set a rotation value, HelixScreen checks whether your display hardware supports rotating the image directly (hardware rotation). Most embedded displays — including DSI screens on Raspberry Pi — do not support hardware rotation for 180°.

When hardware rotation is not available, HelixScreen automatically switches from the GPU-accelerated DRM backend to the framebuffer (fbdev) backend, which handles software rotation flicker-free. This happens transparently — you don't need to configure anything. You'll see this in the logs:

```
DRM lacks hardware rotation for 180°, falling back to fbdev (flicker-free software rotation)
```

The fbdev backend with software rotation works well for normal UI usage. If you notice any issues, you can also force the fbdev backend manually:

```bash
sudo systemctl edit helixscreen
```

Add:
```ini
[Service]
Environment="HELIX_DISPLAY_BACKEND=fbdev"
```

Then restart: `sudo systemctl restart helixscreen`

**To re-run automatic detection:**

Remove the `rotate` and `rotation_probed` keys from your config file's `display` section, then restart HelixScreen:

```json
{
  "display": {
    // remove "rotate" and "rotation_probed" from here
  }
}
```

> **Note:** Old configs may have `"display_rotate": 180` at the root level. This is automatically migrated to the new format on startup.

---

### Colors are wrong (red and blue swapped)

**Symptoms:**
- Red images appear blue and blue images appear red
- Green colors display correctly
- UI elements with red/blue tints look "off"

**Cause:**
Your display's framebuffer uses BGR pixel order instead of RGB, but the kernel driver reports the wrong format. This is common on some Allwinner SoCs (H616, R818, etc.) with RGB parallel (40-pin) display interfaces.

HelixScreen auto-detects BGR layout from the kernel's `fb_var_screeninfo`, but some display drivers report incorrect pixel offsets. You can verify with:

```bash
fbset -i -fb /dev/fb0
```

Look at the `rgba` line. If it shows `8/16,8/8,8/0,0/24` (red at offset 16), the kernel claims RGB. If your colors are swapped despite this, the kernel is wrong and you need a manual override.

**Solution:**

Add this line to your `helixscreen.env` file (typically `~/helixscreen/config/helixscreen.env`):

```bash
HELIX_COLOR_SWAP_RB=1
```

Then restart HelixScreen:
```bash
sudo systemctl restart helixscreen
```

To disable the swap (if auto-detection is wrong in the other direction), use `HELIX_COLOR_SWAP_RB=0`.

**Verifying the fix:**
After restart, flags on the language selection screen should show correct colors (e.g., the French flag should be blue-white-red, not red-white-blue).

---

### Random solid colors during screen sleep (AD5X)

**Symptoms:**
- After the screen goes to sleep (idle timeout), the display shows a solid red, green, or blue fill instead of a black/off screen
- Color may differ each time the screen sleeps
- Touching the screen wakes it normally and the UI returns fine
- Only affects the FlashForge Adventurer 5X

**Cause:**
A driver-level quirk in the AD5X's Allwinner display pipeline. When HelixScreen tells the screen to sleep, the display controller on some AD5X units emits a solid primary-color fill instead of a blank frame. This is not a HelixScreen rendering bug — it does not affect printing, connectivity, or anything else. We have not yet been able to reproduce it reliably on our hardware, so there is no code fix available today.

**Workaround 1 — Disable screen sleep (simplest):**

1. Tap the gear icon to open **Settings**
2. Open **Display**
3. Set **Sleep** to **Never**

The screen will stay on continuously. Power the touchscreen off at the wall if you want it dark when not in use.

**Workaround 2 — Keep backlight on during sleep (preserves sleep logic):**

This keeps the normal sleep timeout but prevents the backlight from being cut, which avoids the color fill. The screen stays lit showing the last-drawn frame.

1. SSH into your printer (or open a shell on the AD5X directly)
2. Edit `~/helixscreen/config/helixconfig.json`
3. Find the `"display"` section and set:

   ```json
   "sleep_backlight_off": false
   ```

4. Save the file and restart HelixScreen:

   ```bash
   sudo systemctl restart helixscreen
   ```

Caveat: the panel stays fully lit 24/7 with this option. If long-term backlight wear is a concern, prefer Workaround 1 and manually power off the screen when not needed.

**Helping us fix it:**
If you are experiencing this and are willing to help, please send a debug bundle from **Settings → Help & About → Send Debug Bundle**. Include a note that mentions the sleep color issue so we can correlate configs and logs.

### 5GHz WiFi networks not showing

**Symptoms:**
- Only 2.4GHz WiFi networks appear in the network list
- 5GHz networks visible in KlipperScreen or other tools but not in HelixScreen
- WiFi adapter supports 5GHz (e.g., AP6256) but only 2.4GHz networks shown

**Cause:**
HelixScreen displays all networks returned by the WiFi subsystem (`wpa_supplicant` or `NetworkManager`). If 5GHz networks are missing, the issue is typically in the underlying WiFi configuration rather than HelixScreen itself.

**Solutions:**

**Check if your WiFi adapter sees 5GHz networks at the OS level:**
```bash
# For NetworkManager systems:
nmcli device wifi list

# For wpa_supplicant systems:
sudo wpa_cli scan
sudo wpa_cli scan_results
```

If 5GHz networks don't appear here either, the issue is in the WiFi driver or configuration.

**Verify 5GHz support is detected:**
```bash
iw phy phy0 info | grep -A 20 "Frequencies"
```
Look for frequencies above 5000 MHz (e.g., 5180, 5240).

**Check wpa_supplicant configuration:**
If your `wpa_supplicant.conf` has a `freq_list=` parameter that only lists 2.4GHz frequencies, 5GHz networks won't be scanned. Remove the `freq_list` line or add 5GHz frequencies.

**Check country code is set:**
5GHz channels require a regulatory domain. Without it, the kernel may block 5GHz scanning:
```bash
sudo iw reg get
```
If it shows "country 00", set your country code:
```bash
sudo iw reg set US   # Replace US with your country code
```

To make permanent, add `country=US` to `/etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf` or set `wifi.powersave = 2` in NetworkManager.

**After changing WiFi hardware** (e.g., swapping from AP6212 to AP6256), a reboot is recommended to ensure the correct driver and firmware are loaded.

## Touch Input Issues

### Touch not responding

**Symptoms:**
- Display works but touch doesn't
- No response to taps

**Causes:**
1. Touch device not detected
2. Wrong input device
3. Permission issues

**Solutions:**

**Check touch device exists:**
```bash
ls /dev/input/event*
cat /proc/bus/input/devices | grep -A5 -i touch
```

**Test touch input:**
```bash
# Install evtest if needed: sudo apt install evtest
sudo evtest /dev/input/event0
# Tap screen and watch for events
```

**Specify touch device in config:**

Edit `settings.json` in your install's `config/` directory (see [Config File Locations](guide/touch-calibration.md#config-file-locations) for the path on your platform). **Stop the service before editing** so the daemon doesn't overwrite your changes.

```json
{
  "input": {
    "touch_device": "/dev/input/event1"
  }
}
```

**Check permissions:**
```bash
ls -la /dev/input/event*
# User needs input group
sudo usermod -aG input $USER
# Log out and back in
```

### Touch Feel — Which Setting Do I Tune?

Three separate settings control the feel of taps vs. scrolls. Match the symptom to the right knob before changing anything — they have different effects and tuning the wrong one makes things worse.

| Symptom | What's happening | Setting to change | Direction |
|---|---|---|---|
| Stationary taps register as swipes/scrolls | Touch controller drifts a few pixels while finger is still, crossing the scroll threshold | `jitter_threshold` | **Raise** (e.g., 15–25) |
| You scroll a list and a button in it fires mid-gesture | Finger released before moving far enough to commit to scroll, so the press becomes a click | `scroll_limit` | **Lower** (e.g., 5) |
| You scroll, lift your finger, and a button fires right as you lift | Touch controller reports release→re-press on lift-off | `scroll_guard` | **Set to `true`** |
| Lists feel sluggish — long coast after a flick | Scroll momentum decays too slowly | `scroll_throw` | **Raise** (e.g., 35) |
| Short flicks never travel far enough — list barely moves | Momentum decays too fast | `scroll_throw` | **Lower** (e.g., 15) |

All four live under `input` in `settings.json` (path varies by platform — see [Config File Locations](guide/touch-calibration.md#config-file-locations)). See [CONFIGURATION.md § Input Configuration](CONFIGURATION.md#input) for the full reference.

> **Stop the service before editing `settings.json`** — the daemon rewrites the file periodically and your edits can be clobbered. Stop, edit, start.
>
> **Want to test a value before committing it?** Each setting has a matching `HELIX_*` env var (see each subsection below). For a one-shot test from SSH, prepend it to a manual launch (e.g. `HELIX_TOUCH_JITTER=25 helix-screen`). To make it persistent across reboots without editing `settings.json`, add it to `helixscreen.env` and restart the service — env vars override `settings.json`.

FlashForge AD5M and AD5X presets ship with `scroll_guard: true` out of the box. Other platforms default to `false`.

---

### Taps Register as Swipes

**Symptoms:**
- Tapping buttons doesn't work — the screen scrolls instead
- Most or all taps are interpreted as swipe/scroll gestures
- Buttons only work when tapped very quickly and precisely

**Cause:** Noisy touch controller (common with Goodix GT9xx and similar capacitive controllers) reports jittery coordinates even when the finger is stationary. The small coordinate changes exceed LVGL's scroll detection threshold.

**Solution:** HelixScreen includes a jitter filter (enabled by default, 5 px dead zone) that suppresses this noise. If taps still register as swipes on your panel, raise the threshold:

```json
{
  "input": {
    "jitter_threshold": 25
  }
}
```

Or test temporarily with an environment variable:
```bash
HELIX_TOUCH_JITTER=25 helix-screen
```

Set to `0` to disable the filter if it interferes with intentional short-travel gestures.

### Unintended Clicks While Scrolling

**Symptoms:**
- You drag a list to scroll and a button in the middle of it fires instead
- The list jumps a little, but the click on whatever was under your finger still goes through
- Happens with short or slow swipes more than long, fast flicks

**Cause:** LVGL treats the first few pixels of finger movement as a "press" on the widget under your finger. Only after you've moved past `scroll_limit` pixels does it cancel the press and commit to a scroll. If you release before reaching that threshold, the press becomes a click.

**Solution:** Lower `scroll_limit` so scrolling engages sooner.

```json
{
  "input": {
    "scroll_limit": 5
  }
}
```

Default is 10; the UI accepts values from 1 to 20. Going too low will make intentional taps feel twitchy — any slight finger wobble will start a scroll — so settle on the lowest value that feels correct, not the smallest possible.

Note that this is a separate problem from the phantom click *after* a scroll (see below) and from taps being misread as swipes (see above).

### Accidental Button Presses After Scrolling

**Symptoms:**
- After scrolling a list, a button press fires when you lift your finger
- Unwanted actions triggered at the end of a scroll gesture

**Cause:** Some capacitive touch controllers generate a phantom "clicked" event when the finger is released after scrolling. Common on FlashForge AD5M/AD5X displays.

**Solution:** Enable the scroll guard, which ignores taps for 80 ms after a scroll ends:

```json
{
  "input": {
    "scroll_guard": true
  }
}
```

This is enabled by default on AD5M and AD5X via their hardware presets. If you see this on other hardware, enable it manually (or test with `HELIX_SCROLL_GUARD=1 helix-screen`).

**Still getting phantom clicks with the guard enabled?** The 80 ms cooldown works for most capacitive controllers but some need longer. Raise `scroll_guard_cooldown_ms` (range 20–500):

```json
{
  "input": {
    "scroll_guard": true,
    "scroll_guard_cooldown_ms": 150
  }
}
```

Or test temporarily with `HELIX_SCROLL_GUARD_COOLDOWN_MS=150 helix-screen`. Try 120, 150, then 200; stop at the smallest value that eliminates the phantom tap, since going higher will start swallowing legitimate taps that closely follow a scroll.

---

### Touch Input is Inaccurate

If taps are landing in the wrong place on screen:

1. **Visualize touch points:** Enable touch debug to draw a ripple at every touch point — easiest way to see if taps are landing where you think they are.

   **Persistent (recommended):** Add this line to `helixscreen.env` (path under [Config File Locations](guide/touch-calibration.md#config-file-locations)) and restart the service:
   ```
   HELIX_DEBUG_TOUCH=1
   ```
   Remove the line and restart when you're done.

   **One-shot from SSH** (stop the service first so it doesn't fight for the touch device):
   ```bash
   helix-screen --debug-touches
   ```
2. **Recalibrate from the UI:** Go to **Settings > System > Touch Calibration**.
3. **If the option isn't visible:** Your screen may not normally need calibration. SSH in, **stop the service**, then run:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl stop helixscreen
   helix-screen --calibrate-touch
   # When done, start the service again:
   sudo systemctl start helixscreen
   ```
4. **If the screen is too broken to navigate (recommended path):** SSH in and set `HELIX_TOUCH_CALIBRATE=1` in your `helixscreen.env`, then restart the service. Remove the line once calibration succeeds — the env var does not self-clear.

For the full menu of options (env var, config-file `force_calibration`, manual CLI, factory reset) plus exact config-file paths for every platform, see the [Touch Calibration Guide § Forcing Recalibration](guide/touch-calibration.md#forcing-recalibration).

> **Don't hand-edit `settings.json` while the service is running** — the daemon rewrites the file periodically and your edits can be clobbered. Stop the service first, edit, then start it again.

### Touch is offset from visual elements

**Symptoms:**
- Touch registers in wrong location
- Have to tap above/below intended target
- Touch accuracy varies across the screen

**Causes:**
- Rotation mismatch between display and touch
- Uncalibrated touch screen

**Solutions:**

**1. Ensure rotation is set correctly:**

The `display.rotate` setting affects both display AND touch automatically. Make sure it matches your physical display orientation:

```json
{
  "display": {
    "rotate": 180
  }
}
```

Restart HelixScreen after changing. Touch coordinates rotate automatically to match — you should not need any separate touch axis configuration.

**2. Run touch calibration:**

1. Go to **Settings** (gear icon in sidebar)
2. Tap **Touch Calibration**
3. Tap the crosshairs that appear accurately
4. Calibration saves automatically

> **Note:** Touch Calibration option only appears on actual touchscreen hardware, not in desktop/SDL mode.

**3. Visualize touch points to diagnose:**

Enable `--debug-touches` to see exactly where touches register, then compare with where you're tapping:
```bash
helix-screen --debug-touches
```
Or set `HELIX_DEBUG_TOUCH=1` in your environment for persistent debugging.

**4. If calibration doesn't help:**

Try different `rotate` values (0, 90, 180, 270) until touch aligns with visuals. Or remove the rotation config entirely and restart to re-trigger automatic detection (see "Display upside down or rotated" above).

### Calibration doesn't help — touches still wildly off

**Symptoms:**
- Calibration wizard completes but touches still land far from where you tap
- Accuracy varies wildly across different screen regions
- Recalibrating multiple times doesn't improve things

**Cause:**
Some touchscreen controllers report X/Y axes that don't match the display orientation. The calibration math tries to compensate but produces a numerically unstable matrix — it technically "works" at the calibration points but falls apart everywhere else.

This is common on devices where the touch controller is mounted at a different orientation than the display panel (e.g., some Sonic Pad configurations).

**Solutions:**

**1. Update to the latest version (recommended):**

HelixScreen v0.9+ automatically detects swapped touch axes during calibration and corrects them. Update and recalibrate:
```bash
# Update HelixScreen, then recalibrate:
# Settings > System > Recalibrate Touch
```

**2. Manual workaround (older versions):**

Set the axis swap environment variable, then recalibrate:
```bash
# Add to your helixscreen.env:
HELIX_TOUCH_SWAP_AXES=1
```
Then restart HelixScreen and run the calibration wizard again. The swap is applied before calibration, so the resulting matrix will be clean and stable.

## Print Issues

### Files not appearing

**Symptoms:**
- Print Select shows empty
- "No files found"
- Known files missing

**Causes:**
1. Moonraker file access issue
2. Wrong file path
3. USB not mounted

**Solutions:**

**Check Moonraker file access:**
```bash
curl http://localhost:7125/server/files/list
```

**Verify gcodes directory:**
```bash
ls -la ~/printer_data/gcodes/
```

**For USB drives, check mount:**
```bash
mount | grep media
ls /media/usb/
```

---

### Print won't start

**Symptoms:**
- Tap Start but nothing happens
- Error message about prerequisites

**Causes:**
1. Klipper not ready
2. Temperature safety checks
3. Homing required

**Solutions:**

**Check Klipper state:**
```bash
curl http://localhost:7125/printer/info | jq '.result.state'
# Should be "ready"
```

**If "error" state, check Klipper logs:**
```bash
tail -50 ~/printer_data/logs/klippy.log
```

**Restart Klipper:**
```bash
sudo systemctl restart klipper
```

---

### Can't pause or cancel print

**Symptoms:**
- Buttons don't respond
- Print continues despite tapping Cancel

**Causes:**
1. Connection issue during print
2. Klipper busy processing

**Solutions:**

**For emergency, use the E-Stop button** - it appears in the header of most panels while a print is active, as well as on the home screen.

**Check connection status** - if disconnected, wait for reconnection.

**Via terminal:**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:7125/printer/print/cancel
```

---

## AMS/Multi-Material Issues

### AMS slots not detected

**Symptoms:**
- AMS panel shows no slots
- "No AMS detected" message

**Causes:**
1. Backend not configured in Klipper
2. Wrong backend type detected
3. Backend not initialized

**Solutions:**

**Verify backend is running:**
```bash
# For Happy Hare - check if mmu object exists
curl -s http://localhost:7125/printer/objects/list | grep -i mmu

# For AFC-Klipper - check if AFC object exists
curl -s http://localhost:7125/printer/objects/list | grep -i afc
```

**Check Klipper logs:**
```bash
grep -i "mmu\|afc\|ams" ~/printer_data/logs/klippy.log | tail -20
```

**Restart services:**
```bash
sudo systemctl restart klipper
sudo systemctl restart moonraker
sudo systemctl restart helixscreen
```

### Load/Unload fails

**Symptoms:**
- Load command sent but no filament movement
- Error messages in notification history

**Solutions:**

**Check filament path:**
Ensure no physical obstructions and buffer tubes are connected.

**Verify homing:**
Run home operation first - many load/unload macros require homing.

**Check temperatures:**
Some backends require extruder at temperature before operations.

---

## Spoolman Issues

### Spoolman not showing

**Symptoms:**
- No Spoolman option in AMS panel
- Spool picker not available

**Causes:**
1. Spoolman not configured in Moonraker
2. Spoolman service not running
3. Connection timeout

**Solutions:**

**Check Spoolman configuration** in `moonraker.conf`:
```ini
[spoolman]
server: http://localhost:7912
```

**Verify Spoolman is running:**
```bash
curl http://localhost:7912/api/v1/health
```

**Restart services:**
```bash
sudo systemctl restart spoolman
sudo systemctl restart moonraker
```

### Spool data not syncing

**Solutions:**

**Force refresh:**
Navigate away from and back to the AMS panel to trigger refresh.

**Check Moonraker logs:**
```bash
sudo journalctl -u moonraker | grep -i spoolman
```

### Only some spools showing in Spoolman lists

**Symptoms:**
- Spool picker or Spoolman panel only shows a subset of your spools
- Missing spools that exist in Spoolman

**Cause:**
HelixScreen currently fetches up to 1,000 spools from Spoolman in a single request. If you have more than 1,000 spools, the rest will not appear.

**Workaround:**
Archive or delete unused spools in Spoolman to stay under 1,000 active spools. A future release will add continuous scroll pagination to handle larger collections.

## Calibration Issues

### Input Shaper measurement fails

**Symptoms:**
- Measurement starts but errors out
- "ADXL not found" error

**Causes:**
1. Accelerometer not connected
2. SPI/I2C configuration issue
3. Klipper input_shaper section missing

**Solutions:**

**Verify ADXL connection via Klipper console:**
```bash
# In Mainsail/Fluidd console, or via:
curl -X POST http://localhost:7125/printer/gcode/script \
  -d '{"script": "ACCELEROMETER_QUERY"}'
```
Should return acceleration values, not an error.

**Check Klipper config** for `[adxl345]` or `[lis2dw12]` section.

**Re-run calibration** after fixing hardware issues.

### Screws tilt shows wrong adjustments

**Symptoms:**
- Adjustment values seem incorrect
- Bed gets worse after adjustments

**Solutions:**

**Verify screw positions** in `printer.cfg`:
```ini
[screws_tilt_adjust]
screw1: 30,30       # Front-left
screw1_name: front left
```

**Check probe accuracy:**
```bash
# In Klipper console:
PROBE_ACCURACY
```
Standard deviation should be < 0.01mm.

---

## Performance Issues

### UI feels slow or laggy

**Symptoms:**
- Delayed response to touches
- Choppy scrolling
- Slow panel transitions

**Diagnosis:**

```bash
# Check CPU and memory
top -b -n 1 | head -20

# Check if swapping (very slow on SD card)
free -h

# Check HelixScreen memory usage
ps aux | grep helix-screen
```

**Common causes and fixes:**

| Cause | Fix |
|-------|-----|
| Debug mode in production | Remove `-vv`/`-vvv` from service, don't use `--test` |
| Animations on slow hardware | Settings → Display → disable Animations |
| Too many G-code files | Large directories with thumbnails use more RAM |
| Other processes hogging CPU | Check `top` for culprits |
| Swapping to SD card | Reduce memory usage or add swap to USB |
| Hardware issues | Settings → Hardware & Devices → Hardware Issues - check for problems |

**To disable verbose logging:**

Edit the service override:
```bash
sudo systemctl edit --force helixscreen
# Remove any -vv or -vvv flags
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl restart helixscreen
```

---

### High memory usage

**Symptoms:**
- Out of memory errors
- System becomes unresponsive
- Crashes during complex operations

**Solutions:**

**Check memory usage:**
```bash
free -h
```

**Reduce Moonraker cache** in `moonraker.conf`:
```ini
[file_manager]
queue_gcode_uploads: False
```

**Limit print history:**
```ini
[history]
max_job_count: 100
```

---

## Configuration Issues

### First-run wizard keeps appearing

**Symptoms:**
- Wizard shows on every boot
- Settings not saved

**Causes:**
- Config file missing, invalid, or not writable
- `wizard_completed` flag not set

**Solutions:**

**Check config exists and is valid JSON** (use your actual install path):
```bash
cat ~/helixscreen/config/settings.json | jq .
```

If the file is missing or invalid, the wizard will run. After completing the wizard, verify:
```bash
grep wizard_completed ~/helixscreen/config/settings.json
# Should show: "wizard_completed": true
```

**Check config directory is writable:**
```bash
ls -la ~/helixscreen/config/
# The helixscreen process needs write access
```

**Create fresh config from template:**
```bash
cp ~/helixscreen/config/settings.json.template \
   ~/helixscreen/config/settings.json
```

> **Note:** Copying the template creates a valid config but with `wizard_completed: false`, so the wizard will still run once to configure your printer.

---

### Settings not saving

**Symptoms:**
- Changes revert after restart
- Config file unchanged

**Solutions:**

**Check config directory is writable:**
```bash
# Test write access (use your actual install path)
touch ~/helixscreen/config/test && rm ~/helixscreen/config/test
echo "Write OK"
```

**Check disk space:**
```bash
df -h
```

**Check for filesystem errors:**
```bash
dmesg | grep -i "read.only\|error\|fault"
```

**Try manual edit to verify:**
```bash
# Stop the service first so it doesn't overwrite your edit:
sudo systemctl stop helixscreen
# Edit settings.json — path varies by platform; see:
#   docs/user/guide/touch-calibration.md § Config File Locations
sudo nano <path-to-your-settings.json>
# Save, then start the service:
sudo systemctl start helixscreen
# Check if change persisted
```

---

### Wrong printer detected

**Symptoms:**
- Wizard shows wrong printer model
- Features missing or wrong

**Solutions:**

**Re-run wizard:**
1. Delete config: `rm ~/helixscreen/config/settings.json`
2. Restart: `sudo systemctl restart helixscreen`
3. Manually select correct printer in wizard

**Manual configuration:**
Edit `~/helixscreen/config/settings.json` to set correct printer type and features.

---

## Flashforge Adventurer 5M Issues

The Flashforge Adventurer 5M (AD5M) has unique characteristics due to its embedded Linux environment and ForgeX/Klipper Mod firmware.

### Screen dims after a few seconds

**Symptoms:**
- Screen dims to ~10% brightness shortly after boot
- Happens about 3 seconds after Klipper starts

**Cause:**
ForgeX's `headless.cfg` has a `reset_screen` delayed_gcode that sets backlight to eco mode.

**Solution:**
The HelixScreen installer automatically patches `/opt/config/mod/.shell/screen.sh` to skip backlight commands when HelixScreen is running. If you installed manually or the patch didn't apply:

```bash
# Check if patch is present
grep helixscreen_active /opt/config/mod/.shell/screen.sh

# If not present, re-run installer or manually add after "backlight)" line:
#     if [ -f /tmp/helixscreen_active ]; then
#         exit 0
#     fi
```

### Black screen after boot

**Symptoms:**
- Display stays black
- SSH works, printer responds

**Causes:**
1. ForgeX not in GUPPY mode
2. GuppyScreen still running
3. Backlight not enabled

**Solutions:**

**Check ForgeX display mode:**
```bash
grep display /opt/config/mod_data/variables.cfg
# Should show: display = 'GUPPY'
```

**Verify GuppyScreen is disabled:**
```bash
ls -la /opt/config/mod/.root/S80guppyscreen
# Should NOT have execute permission (no 'x')
```

**Check HelixScreen is running:**
```bash
/etc/init.d/S90helixscreen status
cat /opt/helixscreen/logs/launcher.log    # AD5M launcher capture
```

### Service commands (SysV init)

AD5M uses SysV init, not systemd. Commands are different:

```bash
# Forge-X
/etc/init.d/S90helixscreen start|stop|restart|status
cat /opt/helixscreen/logs/launcher.log
grep helix-screen /var/log/messages | tail -100    # structured app log

# Klipper Mod
/etc/init.d/S80helixscreen start|stop|restart|status
cat /opt/helixscreen/logs/launcher.log
grep helix-screen /var/log/messages | tail -100
```

> The `launcher.log` file captures startup messages and crash output from the supervisor shell. The full structured app log (everything the app itself logs) goes to the system log (`/var/log/messages`). You usually want both when reporting an issue. On pre-v0.99.62 installs the launcher log lived at `/tmp/helixscreen.log` — check that path if `launcher.log` doesn't exist.

### SSH/SCP notes

AD5M's BusyBox has limitations:

```bash
# Use legacy SCP protocol (no sftp-server)
scp -O localfile root@<printer-ip>:/path/

# Use IP address, not hostname (mDNS may not resolve)
ssh root@192.168.1.67

# Extract zip archives with unzip
unzip archive.zip

# Alternative: use rsync if available
rsync -avz localfile root@<printer-ip>:/path/
```

#### Windows users: `scp -O` not supported

Windows 11's built-in OpenSSH does not support the `-O` flag. Use one of these alternatives:

1. **WSL (recommended)** — Open a WSL terminal (Ubuntu, Debian, etc.) and run all commands exactly as shown in the install guide. Everything works natively.

2. **WinSCP** (free GUI) — Download from [winscp.net](https://winscp.net/). When connecting, set the protocol to **SCP** (not SFTP). Then drag and drop files to the printer.

3. **PuTTY pscp** (free command-line) — Download from [putty.org](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html). Use `pscp` instead of `scp -O`:
   ```
   pscp helixscreen-ad5m.zip root@<printer-ip>:/data/
   ```

### ForgeX not installed

**Symptoms:**
- Installer fails or skips ForgeX configuration
- HelixScreen runs but backlight doesn't work

**Solution:**
HelixScreen requires ForgeX to be installed first. Install ForgeX following [their instructions](https://github.com/DrA1ex/ff5m), verify GuppyScreen works, then run the HelixScreen installer.

### Restoring GuppyScreen

To go back to GuppyScreen:

```bash
# Automated (recommended)
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/prestonbrown/helixscreen/main/scripts/install.sh | bash -s -- --uninstall

# Manual
/etc/init.d/S90helixscreen stop
rm /etc/init.d/S90helixscreen
rm -rf /opt/helixscreen
chmod +x /opt/config/mod/.root/S80guppyscreen
chmod +x /opt/config/mod/.root/S35tslib
reboot
```

## Gathering Diagnostic Information

When reporting issues, gather this information. **Most importantly, enable debug logging first** so the logs contain enough detail to diagnose the problem.

### Enabling Debug Logging

By default, HelixScreen only logs warnings and errors. To capture useful diagnostic information, you need to temporarily enable debug-level logging, reproduce the problem, then collect the logs.

**Quickest method:** Go to **Settings > System > Log Level** and select **Debug**. This takes effect immediately with no restart needed. Remember to set it back to **Warn** when done.

**Verbosity levels:**
| Flag | Level | What it captures |
|------|-------|-----------------|
| *(none)* | WARN | Errors and warnings only (production default) |
| `-v` | INFO | Connection events, panel changes, milestones |
| `-vv` | DEBUG | State changes, API calls, component init (**use this for bug reports**) |
| `-vvv` | TRACE | Everything including LVGL internals (very verbose, rarely needed) |

#### MainsailOS / Raspberry Pi (systemd)

**Option A: Temporary override (recommended)**
```bash
# Create a service override that adds debug logging
sudo systemctl edit --force helixscreen
```

Add these lines (replace the path with your actual install location):
```ini
[Service]
ExecStart=
ExecStart=/home/biqu/helixscreen/bin/helix-launcher.sh --debug
```

Then restart:
```bash
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl restart helixscreen
```

**Option B: One-shot manual run**

Stop the service and run manually with console output:
```bash
sudo systemctl stop helixscreen
cd ~/helixscreen   # or /opt/helixscreen
sudo ./bin/helix-launcher.sh --debug --log-dest=console
# Reproduce the issue, then Ctrl+C to stop
```

**Option C: Environment variable**

Add to the service file:
```ini
[Service]
Environment="HELIX_LOG_LEVEL=debug"
```

#### Flashforge Adventurer 5M / Forge-X (SysV init)

```bash
# Stop the running service
/etc/init.d/S90helixscreen stop   # or S80helixscreen for Klipper Mod

# Run manually with debug output
cd /opt/helixscreen
./bin/helix-launcher.sh --debug --log-dest=console 2>&1 | tee /tmp/helix-debug.log
# Reproduce the issue, then Ctrl+C to stop

# Restart the service normally when done
/etc/init.d/S90helixscreen start
```

#### After collecting logs

**Remove the debug override** to restore normal performance:

```bash
# MainsailOS: remove the override
sudo systemctl revert helixscreen   # or: sudo rm /etc/systemd/system/helixscreen.service.d/override.conf
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl restart helixscreen
```

> **Important:** Debug logging increases CPU usage and log volume. Don't leave it enabled in production.

### System Information

```bash
# HelixScreen version (use your actual install path)
~/helixscreen/bin/helix-screen --version

# OS version
cat /etc/os-release

# Hardware
cat /proc/cpuinfo | grep Model
free -h
```

### Collecting Logs

**MainsailOS (systemd):**
```bash
# Recent logs (last 200 lines, with timestamps)
sudo journalctl -u helixscreen -n 200 --no-pager -o short-iso

# Logs since last restart
sudo journalctl -u helixscreen --since "$(systemctl show helixscreen --property=ActiveEnterTimestamp --value)" --no-pager

# Errors only (useful for a quick summary)
sudo journalctl -u helixscreen -p err --no-pager

# Follow live (while reproducing the issue)
sudo journalctl -u helixscreen -f
```

**Flashforge Adventurer 5M (SysV init, BusyBox syslog):**

Two streams to collect — both are needed when reporting an issue:

```bash
# 1) Structured app log (everything from spdlog: connection events, errors, etc.)
grep helix-screen /var/log/messages | tail -200

# 2) Launcher / supervisor capture (startup banner, crash output, glibc abort messages)
tail -200 /opt/helixscreen/logs/launcher.log    # pre-v0.99.62 installs: /tmp/helixscreen.log

# Follow the system log live while reproducing the issue
tail -f /var/log/messages | grep helix-screen
```

**Creality K1 / K1C / K2 (BusyBox in-memory syslog):**
```bash
# Structured app log — held in a RAM ring buffer, vanishes on reboot
logread | grep helix-screen | tail -200

# Launcher / supervisor capture
tail -200 /usr/data/helixscreen/logs/launcher.log
```

**Flashforge AD5X (ZMOD MIPS):**
```bash
logread | grep helix-screen | tail -200
tail -200 /usr/data/helixscreen/logs/launcher.log
# ghzserg's S80helixscreen also writes here:
tail -200 /opt/config/mod_data/log/helixscreen.log
```

**Snapmaker U1:**
```bash
grep helix-screen /var/log/messages | tail -200
tail -200 /var/log/helixscreen/launcher.log
```

**Elegoo Centauri Carbon (COSMOS):**
```bash
logread | grep helix-screen | tail -200
tail -200 /user-resource/helixscreen/logs/launcher.log
```

### Configuration

```bash
# Current config (sanitize API keys before sharing!)
# Pi: ~/helixscreen/config/ or /opt/helixscreen/config/
cat ~/helixscreen/config/settings.json
```

### Display Information

```bash
# Framebuffer
ls -la /dev/fb*

# DRM devices
ls -la /dev/dri/

# Input devices
ls -la /dev/input/
cat /proc/bus/input/devices
```
